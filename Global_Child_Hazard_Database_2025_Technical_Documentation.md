# Preamble

UNICEF's first Global Child Hazard Database is designed to be a critical
resource to provide comprehensive and reliable hazard data essential for
safeguarding children\'s rights and well-being worldwide. It serves a
multitude of vital purposes, enabling more effective and targeted
interventions in the face of increasing global hazards.

Key applications of this database include:

- **Multiple Hazard Exposure Analysis:** The database facilitates
  detailed analysis of children\'s exposure to multiple hazards at
  varying intensities, helping stakeholders to pinpoint hotspot areas.

- **Children\'s Climate Risk Index (CCRI):** The database is
  foundational for the CCRI, providing the necessary hazard exposure
  data, allowing for a robust assessment of child-specific climate
  risks, especially at national level. For subnational assessments such
  as CCRI-DRM, the database could support hazard exposure data if
  country level data is unavailable.

- **Emergency Preparedness and Response:** By providing insights into
  potential hazard impacts and historical occurrences, the database is
  crucial for developing robust emergency preparedness plans, informing
  anticipatory action, and guiding immediate disaster response and
  recovery efforts.

- **Climate Financing:** The data can be leveraged to advocate for
  climate financing towards regions and communities most vulnerable to
  hazards, ensuring resources are allocated effectively to build
  resilience and implement adaptation strategies.

- **Programming and Targeting:** The database support the design and
  implementation of child-focused programs by identifying high-risk
  areas and populations, allowing for precise targeting of interventions
  to reduce children\'s vulnerability including providing estimates for
  the next UNICEF Strategic Plan. It can also be used for sub-national
  equity analysis and Climate Landscape Analysis.

- **Influencing International and National Policy:** By providing
  concrete, evidence-based data on child exposure to hazards, the
  database is an invaluable tool for advocating for and shaping policies
  at both national and international levels, driving legislative and
  strategic changes to protect children from various hazards.

- **Research and Academic Study:** The standardized and comprehensive
  nature of the database makes it a valuable resource for academic
  research, fostering a deeper understanding of the complex interactions
  between hazards, climate change, and child welfare.

- **Disaster Risk Reduction Strategies:** Understanding the spatial and
  temporal characteristics of hazards allows for the development and
  implementation of targeted disaster risk reduction strategies,
  focusing on prevention, mitigation, and adaptation measures.

This technical documentation serves as a live document, with new hazard
layers and updates to be incorporated as data becomes available,
ensuring the database remains a cutting-edge and adaptable tool in
providing evidence.

While the first version of the database only includes climate hazards,
other relevant hazards (geophysical, conflict) will be added in 2025 Q3
and potentially expanding to include environmental indicators in 2025 Q4
and beyond (as data becomes available).

# Introduction

UNICEF plays a crucial role in protecting and promoting the rights of
children worldwide. As children around the world are increasingly
exposed to multiple hazards, access to reliable and comprehensive hazard
data is essential for effective programming and advocacy. This handbook
aims to provide an overview of the various types of hazard data
available, as well as guidance on how to access, analyze, understand,
visualize and utilize this data.

The primary audience for this handbook is all relevant UNICEF staff and
partners. This is intended to be a live document and new hazard layers
will be added/updated as data becomes available in the future.

**Why do we need a standardized Global Child Hazard Database?**

Standardization is needed to ensure a shared understanding of these
diverse datasets with comparability and consistency and includes the
following key areas.

# Understanding Hazard Data 

A hazard can be defined as any process, phenomenon or human activity
that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property
damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation.

**Hazard Categories**

Classification of hazards varies across different institutions and for
the Global Child Hazard Database, UNDRR's terminology and classification
schemes have been applied and are categorized into the following general
categories:

- **Hydrometeorological hazards**Â are of atmospheric, hydrological or
  oceanographic origin. Examples are tropical cyclones (also known as
  typhoons and hurricanes); floods, including flash floods; drought;
  heatwaves and cold spells; and coastal storm surges.
  Hydrometeorological conditions may also be a factor in other hazards
  such as landslides, wildland fires, locust plagues, epidemics and in
  the transport and dispersal of toxic substances and volcanic eruption
  material (UNDRR, 2020).

It is important to note the following distinctions:

- **Climate data** refers to measurements of atmospheric conditions over
  time and encompasses a wide range of meteorological variables -- from
  temperature, precipitation, sea level rise and wind patterns. Climate
  data is used to better understand long term climate patterns, trends,
  and future conditions. This could be both observed and/or modelled
  data and includes both historical data and future projections (more
  details under section 1.3).

- **Climate hazard** refers to natural events that are pre-dominantly
  hydro-meteorological in nature such as floods, tropical storms,
  heatwaves, wildfires and droughts. These hazards can be exacerbated by
  climate change, leading to increased frequency, intensity, and
  unpredictability. Understanding climate hazards is core to risk
  analysis, emergency preparedness and planning for effective mitigation
  and adaptation.

- **Climate change** refers to the change in climate over an extended
  period caused by natural processes such as volcanic eruptions or
  variations in solar radiation as well as human activities such as over
  burning fossil fuels, deforestation and over emission of greenhouse
  gases. There is adequate evidence that anthropogenic climate change is
  increasing the frequency and intensity of climate hazards as well as
  influence along with existing natural variability that causes climate
  hazards. In other words, not all climate hazards are results of
  human-induced climate change. Attribution to climate change is a
  complex process and at the time of this writing, there is still
  limited data available to differentiate the two.

<!-- -->

- **Climate sensitive** hazards could be used to refer to air pollution
  and diseases (vector borne such as malaria, dengue, zika and
  water-borne such as cholera) which could be intensified because of
  climate crisis

- **Environmental Hazards** may include chemical, natural and biological
  hazards. They can be created by environmental degradation or physical
  or chemical pollution in the air, water and soil. However, many of the
  processes and phenomena that fall into this category may be termed
  drivers of hazard and risk rather than hazards in themselves, such as
  soil degradation, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, salinization
  and sea-level rise (UNDRR, 2020).

- **Geophysical hazards**Â originate from internal earth processes.
  Examples are earthquakes, volcanic activity and emissions, and related
  geophysical processes such as mass movements, landslides, rockslides,
  surface collapses and debris or mud flows. Hydrometeorological factors
  are important contributors to some of these processes. Tsunamis are
  difficult to categorize although they are triggered by undersea
  earthquakes and other geological events, they essentially become an
  oceanic process that is manifested as a coastal water-related hazard
  (UNDRR, 2020).

*All the above are interconnected and contribute to improving our
understanding of the triple planetary crisis. Each hazard often triggers
a sub-set of hazards, for instance tropical cyclones (known as
hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, cyclones in the Indian Ocean and
typhoons in the Northern Pacific Ocean) can bring intense winds, storm
surge and heavy rainfall, as well as trigger secondary hazards, for
instance landslides. A series of triggering relationships can cause a
domino or cascading effect (UNDRR, 2020).*

**Hazard Characteristics**

Hazards occur at different magnitudes (intensity) over different time
scales (duration) and can occur multiple times (frequency). In general,
intensities can be expressed in terms of absolute measures such as km/hr
for cyclone windspeed or m depth for flood. Return periods are used to
combine both measures. In general, the longer the return period (the
less frequent the hazard) the greater the intensity of the hazard
(UNDRR, 2020). Interaction between multiple hazards could result in an
overall impact that is greater than a single hazard happening at
different times.

**Know your hazard data type!**

Once hazards are identified, the next step is to collect a range of
hazard-related data that shows spatial and temporal characteristics.
There are five different phases of hazard data to be considered
depending on the use cases. While some can be substituted for others,
not all can be used inter-changeably. The process can be challenging due
to data limitations and in determining how best to consider secondary
hazards that can be triggered by a primary event.

1.  **Probabilistic/Modelled Data**

Probabilistic hazard models are generated through computer simulations
using complex mathematical models and rely on statistical analysis of
past data. These models help the users to understand areas that could
potentially be impacted by a specific hazard and are usually available
in different Return Periods. A Return Period represents the average
interval of time between occurrences of the event. It is important to
note that this does not mean the event will happen exactly once every
100 years. Instead, it indicates aÂ 1% probabilityÂ of the event occurring
in any given year. Similarly, a 10-year return period event has aÂ 10%
probabilityÂ of occurring in any given year.

A 100-year return period has been chosen as the default as it has a high
chance of an event of a considerable magnitude happening within a
lifetime. For example, aÂ 100-year floodÂ is a flood that has aÂ 1%
probabilityÂ of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. There is
approximately aÂ 63.4% chanceÂ of experiencing at least one 100-year flood
within a 100-year period.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Used in risk assessments, preparedness, and planning.

2.  **Historical Observations**

Historical observations provide a baseline for understanding the
frequency, intensity, and spatial distribution of hazards. This data is
usually collected over a significant period to document past
occurrences, helping users to understand the spatial and temporal
distribution of each hazard. For example, 20 years of observed flood
data from the Ganges plains could help us understand the possible areas
at risk for floods. It is to note that global historical observation
databases for many hazards are largely incomplete and often not updated
regularly with spatial extent.

Used in risk assessments, preparedness, and planning.

3.  **Forecast**

Forecasts offer short-term predictions of specific climate hazard
events, enabling early warning systems and helping communities prepare
for potential impacts. Hurricane forecasts, wildfire risk assessments,
and flood warnings are examples of climate forecasts.

Used in anticipatory action and early warning.

4.  **Impact**

Impact data assesses the consequences of climate hazards on people,
property, and the environment. Understanding impacts helps to assess
vulnerability and develop effective mitigation and adaptation
strategies. Economic losses, loss of life, damage to infrastructure, and
ecosystem disruption are some of the potential impacts of climate
hazards. For example, satellite-based flood observations are used for
flood response immediately after an event.

Used in disaster response and recovery -- also added to the historical
observations.

5.  **Projected Data**

Projected data are future predictions of climate hazards based on
climate models and historical observations. Projections of sea-level
rise, extreme precipitation events, and heatwave frequency are examples
of projected data that help us anticipate future risks. While in the
plans, data on climate projection is not included in the Global Child
Hazard Database (as of writing).

Used in long-term programme planning and resilience (when reliable) --
this is still largely in the research phase.

probabilistic models and historical observations and does not include
forecast, impact and projection data which could potentially be included
in the subsequent versions depending on resource availability and
needs.]{.underline}*

**What is an extreme event?**

It is not straight forward to define extreme weather events. As a rule
of thumb, if an event significantly deviates from the norm in terms of
their intensity, duration and impact, it could be considered as extreme
events and for each hazard, thresholds are determined using expert
input.

**What is climate attribution?**

Attribution in climate science determines the human influence on
specific weather events. It answers: \"Did human-caused climate change
make this event more likely or intense?\" This involves comparing the
event\'s probability and intensity in the current climate versus a
hypothetical one without human greenhouse gas emissions.

# Data Acquisition and Cataloging

Multiple data sources were considered for each hazard and were carefully
evaluated. The final selection is identified based on the following
pre-established criteria: All input data must be open, globally
available for all countries, quantifiable and comparable but most
importantly spatially distributed. The diagram below shows the six
criteria used in data selection.

![](./media/image2.png){width="5.170476815398075in"
height="2.087179571303587in"}

Proxy indicators are considered where global open data is not available.
Quality dimension of basic data is considered to maximize the overall
quality of the final CCRI, and within the constraints of data
availability and include their relevance, accuracy, timeliness,
accessibility, interpretability and coherence (OECD, 2008).

# Hazard Data Processing

The functionality of this database is contingent upon precise hazard
data processing. This section details the methodologies for data
acquisition, standardization, quality control, and integration of
diverse hazard datasets. These processes ensure data consistency,
accuracy, and interoperability, enabling comprehensive analysis and
supporting evidence-based decision-making.

**Children Population data:**

WorldPop's global gridded children population estimate (Under 18) for
2024 at 100m spatial resolution was used for all exposure analysis in
Global Child Hazard Database. The constrained population data product
was used. Individual country population data is first downloaded and
mosaicked into a single, global composite layer for further processing.
Worldpop is chosen for its higher resolution, global availability and as
it has the least bias in estimating rural population (Ritter, 2025).

Limitations:

WorldPop is a modeled product that disaggregates coarser census or
projected data onto finer grids using various geospatial covariates;
thus, the accuracy of its output is intrinsically linked to the age and
reliability of its input data. While some WorldPop datasets are adjusted
to align with UN WPP national totals, the underlying spatial
distribution might still differ from official national census figures or
the detailed demographic structures assumed by the UN\'s own
projections, as WorldPop\'s modeling cannot fully replicate the granular
information gathered through comprehensive national censuses.

**Hazard data:**

## Flood 

Floods are the natural hazard with the highest frequency and widest
geographic distribution (UNISDR, 2017) and are described in terms of
frequency and intensity (water extent and depth). There are three common
types of flooding.

- Fluvial (riverine)

- Coastal (storm surge / sea level rise)

- Pluvial (surface water / flash floods)

Relevance:

Floods are a critical concern in climate change discussions due to their
widespread impact on human and natural systems. According to the IPCC
2022 AR 6 report, food risks and societal damages are projected to
increase with every increment of global warming (medium confidence)
(IPCC, 2022). They exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, particularly in
communities already facing socioeconomic challenges. Children are
especially vulnerable to the impacts of floods. Floods can disrupt their
access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare, leading to increased
risks of diseases. Additionally, floods can cause significant
psychological stress and trauma, affecting children\'s mental health and
development (IPCC, 2022).

**Fluvial Flood**

A fluvial or riverine flood is a rise, usually brief, in the water level
of a stream or water body to a peak from which the water level recedes
at a slower rate (WMO, 2012). The primary cause of a fluvial flood is an
extended precipitation event that occurs at, or upstream from, the
affected area and can also occur when traditional flood-control
structures, such as levees and dikes, are overtopped.

Data source:

Fluvial flood has been extensively studied, and multiple global models
are freely available at different return periods. JRC's gridded Global
Flood Hazard model (Baugh, 2024) at 100-year return period and 90m
spatial resolution has been chosen and water depth above 1cm (defined as
data pixel value greater than or equal to in our processing pipeline)
has been considered for exposure analysis.

Data processing:

Children's exposure to riverine flood hazard was calculated by simple
overlay of the flood hazard and the high-resolution gridded global child
population layer. The results were then summarized to different
administrative boundaries as absolute and relative values for all the
Member States and territories using zonal statistics.

Coverage: Global

Indicators:

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to riverine floods

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures riverine floods

Data limitations: While major riverine floods have been modelled at
higher resolution, data might not cover smaller rivers.

**Coastal Flood**

Coastal flooding is most frequently the result of storm surges and high
winds coinciding with high tides (WMO, 2011).

Data source:

A few open, global coastal flood models were compared at different
return periods. For Global Child Hazard Database, JRC's gridded Global
Coastal Flood Hazard model at 100-year return period and 90m spatial
resolution has been chosen. This is a binary layer, and all values
identified as 1 are considered for exposure analysis.

Data processing:

Children's exposure to coastal flood hazard was calculated by simple
overlay of the flood hazard and the high-resolution gridded global child
population layer. The results were then summarized to different
administrative boundaries as absolute and relative values for all the
Member States and territories using zonal statistics. Coastal flood does
not have any thresholding, it is a binary 0, 1 non-presence or presence
of flood used to calculate exposure.

Coverage: Global

Indicators:

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to coastal floods

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to coastal floods

Data limitations:

JRC's coastal flood hazard layer does not include intensity (depth)
information, which could be crucial to better estimate the exposure to
different impacts on children.

## Drought 

Drought is a prolonged dry period in the natural climate cycle that can
occur anywhere in the world. It is typically a slowâ¯on-set phenomenon
caused by a lack of rainfall and can occur in four stages that are
usually categorized as four drought types.

- Meteorological drought

- Agricultural drought

- Hydrological drought

- Socio-economic drought

Relevance:

Drought has always been a part of the natural variability of Earth's
climate.â¯Climate change increasingly puts pressure on food production
and access, especially in vulnerable regions, and undermines food
security and nutrition (WMO, 2012) The increase in the frequency,
intensity, and duration of droughts will increase risks to food security
(IPCC, 2022). Children are especially impacted by various drought risks.
The lack of water can compromise their access to clean drinking water
and sanitation, increasing the risk of diseases. Additionally, droughts
can lead to food shortages, impacting children\'s nutrition and overall
health. The psychological stress and trauma associated with drought
conditions can also affect children\'s mental health and development
(IPCC, 2022).

**Agricultural Drought**

Agricultural drought occurs when there is insufficient soil moisture to
meet the needs of a particular crop at a particular time (FAO, 2025).

Data source:

The Agricultural Stress Index (ASI) facilitates the early identification
of cropped land with a high likelihood of water stress (drought).Â The
Index is based on the integration of the Vegetation Health Index (VHI)
in two dimensions that are critical in the assessment of a drought event
in agriculture: temporal and spatial. The first step is a temporal
averaging of the VHI, assessing the intensity and duration of dry
periods occurring during the crop cycle at the pixel level. The second
step determines the spatial extent of drought events by calculating the
percentage of pixels in arable areas with a VHI value below 35 percent
(this value was identified as a critical threshold in assessing the
extent of drought in previous research by Kogan, 1995). Each
administrative area is classified according to the percentage of the
affected area to facilitate the quick interpretation of results (FAO,
2025). A 100-year return period was generated using the long-term
average from 1984 - 2023 as a proxy as it depicts the percentage of
arable land, within an administrative area, that has been affected by
drought conditions over the entire cropping season.

Data processing:

Children's exposure to agricultural drought was calculated by simple
overlay of the areas where the 100-year ASI return period with over 30%
cropland is affected and the high-resolution gridded global child
population layer. The results were then summarized to different
administrative boundaries as absolute and relative values for all the
Member States and territories using zonal statistics.

Coverage: Global

Indicators:

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to agricultural droughts

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to agricultural droughts

Data limitations:

Drought is one of the most complex natural hazards and the impact is
felt in places that are in proximity as well as those areas that rely on
the food supply. In other words, drought can occur in one place and the
impact can be felt anywhere that depends on the crop production, even in
adjacent or far away countries. For the lack of better model, the
drought exposure estimates in the database assumes children living in
areas close to the actual location of agricultural drought to be
directly affected and does not consider children living in areas that
depend on the crop production as their primary food source which is hard
to model globally.

**Meteorological Drought**

Definition:\
Meteorological drought occurs when dry weather patterns dominate an
area, defined by the degree of dryness and the duration of the dry
period (WMO, 2021).

Data Source:

The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized
Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) were sourced from the
European Copernicus Global Drought Observatory, available at \~25 km
spatial resolution.

- SPI measures the deviation of precipitation from the climatological
  average over a given accumulation period and is widely used to detect
  and characterize meteorological droughts.

- SPEI adds the effect of evapotranspiration and is better suited to
  assess droughts under climate change scenarios where temperature
  changes are important.\
  Longer accumulation periods (e.g., 12 months) are associated with
  persistent droughts and may also reflect agricultural and hydrological
  drought conditions (Copernicus, 2025).

> Data Processing:

- Monthly aggregated SPI and SPEI data using a 12-month accumulation
  period were used for the years 2014--2024.

- Areas experiencing meteorological drought were identified as those
  with SPI or SPEI \< -1, corresponding to approximately the driest 10%
  of conditions.

- These areas were overlaid with a high-resolution gridded global child
  population dataset to estimate exposure.

- Zonal statistics were used to summarize both absolute counts and
  relative proportions of exposed populations (children and total
  population, disaggregated by sex) across multiple administrative
  boundaries.

Coverage: Global

Indicators:

- Absolute exposure of children to Meteorological hazards (counts):

  - Normalized exposure scores (SPI and SPEI)

- Relative exposure of children to Meteorological hazards (percent of
  population):

  - Children (total, girls, boys)

  - People (total, women, men)

  - Normalized exposure scores (SPI and SPEI)

Data Limitations:

- The drought datasets have coarser spatial resolution (\~25 km)
  compared to some other hazard data layers such as ASI (Agricultural
  Stress Index).

- Return period analysis (e.g., Gumbel fitting for extreme dryness) was
  not satisfactory due to:

  - The sparse frequency of extreme dry events in the observation period

  - The distribution of SPI and SPEI values across both negative and
    positive ranges, complicating traditional extreme value fitting.

## Tropical Storms

A tropical storm is a type of storm system characterized by a
low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong
winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain
(WMO, 2021). Tropical storm classification is adopted from WMO's
guidance where wind speed greater than 63 km/hr is considered as a named
tropical storm (WMO, 2023)

Relevance:

Tropical storms can cause significant damage through high winds, heavy
rainfall, and storm surges, leading to flooding, property destruction,
and loss of life. Climate change is increasing the intensity and
frequency of tropical storms. Warmer sea surface temperatures and higher
atmospheric moisture levels contribute to more powerful storms with
greater precipitation. This intensification is linked to human-induced
greenhouse gas emissions, which have led to observable changes in storm
patterns and behaviors (IPCC, 2022). Children are particularly
vulnerable to the effects of tropical storms. These events can disrupt
their access to clean water, food, and healthcare, increasing the risk
of malnutrition and diseases and can lead to psychological trauma.

Data source:

The tropical cyclone wind data is derived from UNEP GIRI and indicates
the mean value of wind velocity for a return period of 100 years. The
map has global coverage and a resolution of 6\' (\~11.1 kilometers at
the equator) (CDRI, 2023). The tracks of historical tropical cyclones
used in GIRI were obtained from the IBTrACS database and hazard analysis
was divided by oceanic basis with different cut off years, based on data
availability (GIRI, 2023)

Data processing:

Children's exposure to tropical storms was calculated by simple overlay
of the areas where the wind speed is over 63 km/hr and the
high-resolution gridded global child population layer. The results were
then summarized to different administrative boundaries as absolute and
relative values for all the Member States and territories using zonal
statistics.

Coverage: Global

Indicators:

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to tropical storms

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to tropical storms

Data limitations:

The accuracy of the probabilistic hazard model depends on the
completeness of historical tropical cyclone data which varies from one
ocean to another. Incomplete data can lead to underestimation or
overestimation of storm exposure.

## Heatwave and Extreme Heat

A heatwave can be defined as a period where local excess heat
accumulates over a sequence of unusually hot days and nights (WMO,
2022). Heatwaves are complex phenomena and at present, there is no
universal consensus on a global metric. The specific criteria for what
constitute a heatwave can vary by region, but it generally involves
temperatures significantly higher than the average for that area and
time of year.

A heatwave is defined as any period of 3 days or more when the maximum
temperature each day is in the top 10% of the local 15-day average and
the following three dimensions were considered:

- Heatwave frequencyÂ refers to the number of heatwaves per year.

- Heatwave durationÂ refers to the total number of days an event lasts.

- Heatwave severityÂ refers to the temperature above the local 15-day
  average during the heatwave, expressed in degrees Celsius.

Extremely high temperaturesÂ (extremely hot days) are estimated when a
day exceeds 35 degrees Celsius.

Relevance:

Temperature is one of the core indicators to describe climate and there
is clear evidence that climate change is increasing global temperatures
and causing historic heat waves all around the world, with higher
frequencies, duration and severity (IPCC, 2022). Children are more
vulnerable to the short- and long-term effects, especially from the heat
stress caused by exposure to heat waves that can negatively affect
health and well-being, especially for infants and young children.
Children sweat less per kilogram than adults and have a higher
metabolism, which means they get hotter quicker. School closures because
of heatwaves are becoming increasingly common, leading to negative
impact on children's education.

It is important to note that heatwaves themselves don't lead to negative
health consequences in all situations. For instance, with the above
definition, heatwave severity increasing in the Nordic countries could
lead to ecological impact which in turn could affect children's ability
to have a quality life. It could lead to increased probability of
wildfires which could decrease the air quality.

Heat stress represents a significant and growing hazard, particularly
for vulnerable populations such as children, due to its direct
physiological impact and exacerbation of existing health conditions. ^1^
While the availability of global data on heat stress exposure is
steadily increasing, facilitating broader analysis, a universally
accepted global threshold for children\'s safe exposure levels currently
remains undefined, highlighting a critical area for further research and
policy development.

Data source:

Temperature inputÂ is calculated using daily aggregate temperature data
from the ERA5 reanalysis (MuÃ±oz, 2019). ERA5, produced by the Copernicus
Climate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF, is the fifth-generation
atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from
January 1940 to present (ECMWF, 2025). A 100-year return period was
generated from the 1960-2024 ERA5 LAND data.

To assess the extremity of climate-related heatwave
indicators---including annual frequency, duration, severity, and the
number of days exceeding 35Â°C---we estimated multi-year return levels
using a non-parametric, empirical approach. For each pixel, annual
values were sorted in descending order, and empirical return periods
were assigned using Weibull plotting positions, i.e., ð=(ð+1)/rank,
where ð is the number of years. Return levels for specific periods
(e.g., 10-, 30-, 50-, and 100-year events) were then derived by
interpolating the observed annual extremes against their associated
empirical return periods. This method avoids distributional assumptions
(e.g., Gumbel or GEV) and is particularly suited for short observational
records or count-based variables such as event frequency. The approach
aligns with recommended practices in climate extremes analysis,
especially when parametric assumptions may not be valid or robust (WMO,
2009; Wilks, 2011; Coles, 2001).

For land areas, we used the ERA5-Land dataset, which offers a spatial
resolution of approximately 10 km. However, since the ERA5-Land product
excludes Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and many island regions
due to its land-sea masking, we used the standard ERA5 dataset at a
coarser resolution of approximately 24 km for those areas. Data for SIDS
was obtained for the same time period as the land areas and processed
using the same methodology to ensure consistency across the analysis.

Data processing:

Children's exposure to individual dimensions was calculated by simple
overlay of the areas where the individual dimension of heatwave is
greater than the long-term average and the high-resolution gridded
global children population layer. The results were then summarized to
different administrative boundaries as absolute and relative values for
all the Member States and territories using zonal statistics.

Coverage: Global

Indicators:

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to heatwave frequency

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to heatwave frequency

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to heatwave duration

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to heatwave duration

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to heatwave severity

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to heatwave severity

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to extreme temperature

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to extreme temperature

Data limitations:

While ERA5-Land offer enhanced resolution (approx. 9 km), it does not
cover Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and ERA5's global layer was
used at 25km resolution. A significant challenge lies in the lack of a
universal definition for \"heatwave\" or \"extreme heat,\" leading to
inconsistencies across different data sources and complicating
cross-regional comparisons. The exclusion of humidity metrics can lead
to an underestimation of actual physiological heat stress. Observational
data sparsity, especially in remote or less developed regions,
introduces uncertainties, and current datasets often do not adequately
capture the localized amplification of temperatures due to the Urban
Heat Island effect. Finally, a critical gap remains in the absence of a
globally accepted physiological threshold for children\'s safe exposure
to heat, hindering precise impact assessments for this highly vulnerable
demographic.

## 

## Sand and Dust Storms 

Sand and dust storms (SDS) are caused by intense winds over areas of
arid soil that pick up large amounts of ground material into the
atmosphere. The most significant dust sources globally are concentrated
in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly major deserts such as the
Sahara in Africa, the Gobi in Asia, and the Arabian Desert in the Middle
East. They originate from natural sources like deserts, dry lake beds,
and coastal regions with loose sediment. Human activities exacerbate the
problem through construction, agriculture, and poor land management
practices that strip vegetation and expose soil to wind erosion. Climate
change amplifies the occurrence of sand and dust storms by altering
weather patterns and reducing vegetation cover. (WMO, 2021).

Relevance:

Over the past few decades, land degradation has contributed
significantly to the increased number and size of anthropogenic SDS
sources. Current trends in deforestation, agricultural expansion, and
more frequent and severe droughts and heatwaves make countries more
susceptible to SDS hazards (UNCCD 2021). Exposure to dust can lead to
respiratory problems, allergies, and other health issues and the
disruption of daily activities and schooling due to poor air quality can
also affect children\'s education and overall wellbeing.

Data source:

UNCCD's Sand and Dust Storm susceptibility layer at 1km resolution is
used. It employs global datasets for four indicators to estimate the
extent of source potential and derive source intensity values: (i) soil
texture (proportion of sand, silt, and clay), (ii) soil moisture
(absolute minimum value), (iii) soil temperature (absolute maximum
value), and (iv) land cover (bare land fraction). (UNCCD, 2024)

Data processing:

Children's exposure to sand and dust storms was calculated by simple
overlay of the areas where there is SDS susceptibility and the
high-resolution gridded global child population layer. The results were
then summarized to different administrative boundaries as absolute and
relative values for all the Member States and territories using zonal
statistics.

Coverage: Global

Indicator:

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to Sand and Dust Storms

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to Sand and Dust Storms

Data limitations:

SDS susceptibility layer includes areas of original source but not where
the wind could transport the particles. This could underestimate the
overall global exposure. The adopted methods in SDS base map also have
limited precision in identifying lower intensity sources due to the lack
of data as well as the high degree of uncertainty associated with
soil-related data (UNCCD, 2024).

## Fires

Wildfires are uncontrolled burns of vegetation, including forests,
shrublands, grasslands, savannas, and croplands. They can be caused by
human activity or natural causes (UNDRR, 2020). Fires caused
deliberately for land clearance (agriculture and ranching) or
accidentally (lightning strikes and human error) are a major factor in
land-cover variability and change and hence affect fluxes of energy and
water to the atmosphere (WMO, 2025).

Relevance:

Fires can lead to significant loss of biodiversity, destruction of
property, and air pollution but they can also contribute to climate
change by releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere (IPCC, 2022). Â Climate change is increasing
the frequency and intensity of fires. Higher temperatures, prolonged
droughts, and changes in vegetation patterns create conditions that are
more conducive to wildfires, and human activities such as land use
changes and deforestation also exacerbate the risk of fires (IPCC,
2022). Children are particularly vulnerable as they are exposed to smoke
and air pollutants from fires that can lead to respiratory problems,
allergies, and other health issues. Fires also impact their overall
well-being, education and could cause significant psychological trauma.

Data source:

Two indicators are used to better understand fires -- Frequency and
Intensity.

Fire frequency is obtained from NASA's Fire Information for Resource
Management System (FIRMS) is used as a proxy for fire hazard. Average
fire frequency from 2001-2023 has been considered. The MODIS Fire and
Thermal Anomalies product is available from the Terra (MOD14) and Aqua
(MYD14) satellites as well as a combined Terra and Aqua (MCD14). The
MODIS Fire and Thermal Anomalies products are derived from the MODIS
sensors onboard the Terra (MOD14) and Aqua (MYD14) satellites. A
combined product, MCD14, is also available and merges detections from
both platforms.\
The nominal spatial resolution of the MODIS fire detection is 1 km, and
the temporal resolution is daily, with up to four observations per day
globally (two from each satellite). The sensor resolution is 1 km, and
the temporal resolution is daily.

Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is a measure of the energy released by a fire
in the form of radiation. It is typically expressed in watts per square
meter per steradian per micrometer (W/mÂ²/sr/Âµm). FRP is an important
parameter for understanding the intensity and behavior of fires, as well
as their impact on the environment. The historical fires are based on
vegetation fires only to capture all climate related events, but it is
possible that the data includes human-induced vegetation fires.

Data processing:

Children's exposure to fires was calculated by simple overlay of the
areas where there is fire frequency above 50 and fire intensity above 10
and the high-resolution gridded global child population layer. The
results were then summarized to different administrative boundaries as
absolute and relative values for all the Member States and territories
using zonal statistics.

Coverage: Global

Indicator:

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to fire frequency

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to fires frequency

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to fire intensity

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to fires intensity

Data limitations:

Fire frequency and intensity are limited in identifying all areas that
have potential to experience fires. It is adopted as a proxy for the
lack of high-resolution global hazard data for Fire Weather Index (FWI)
-- a combination of which could give a better picture of fire hazard.

## Air Pollution

Air pollution refers to the presence of substances in the atmosphere
that are harmful to human health and the environment. These substances
can include particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon
monoxide, and ozone (WHO, 2021).

Relevance:

Climate change and air pollution are closely linked. Many activities
that produce greenhouse gases also emit air pollutants, which can act as
short-lived climate forcers and can warm or cool the Earth\'s climate
over shorter time scales (IPCC, 2022). Air pollution threatens
children\'s health and is the biggest environmental health risk factor
(UNICEF, 2024). Exposure to pollutants can lead to respiratory problems,
asthma, and other health issues. Poor air quality can also affect
children\'s development and cognitive function. Air pollution was the
second leading risk factor for death among children under five in 2021,
after malnutrition.

**Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5):**

Fine particle air pollution, or PM2 .5, refers to airborne particles
measuring less than 2 .5 micrometers in diameter that could be emitted
from vehicles, residential fuel use, coal-burning power plants,
agricultural and industrial activities, waste burning, wildfires, and
many other human and natural sources. Among the key air pollutants that
are currently measured, long-term exposure to PM2.5 is the most
consistent and accurate predictor of poor health outcomes across
populations. (Health Effects Institute, 2024)

Data source:

Data from the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group (ACAG) were global
concentrations of PM 2.5 estimated using information from satellite-,
simulation- and monitor-based sources was used (Shen et al, 2024).
Following the established WHO standards for air quality guidance, a
threshold of 5 Î¼g/m3 is adopted (WHO, 2021) and to account for short
term variations such as decrease in air pollution during covid-19
pandemic, a ten-year average was considered following expert advice.

Data processing:

Children's exposure to particulate matter 2.5 was calculated by simple
overlay of the areas where there is observed values of a ten-year
average (2012 -- 2022) was greater than 5 Î¼g/m3 and the high-resolution
gridded global child population layer. The results were then summarized
to different administrative boundaries as absolute and relative values
for all the Member States and territories using zonal statistics.

Coverage: Global

Indicator:

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to air pollution

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to air pollution

Data limitations:

On-the-ground air quality monitoring stations are few and far between in
many regions of the world, particularly in low- and middle-income
countries which could affect the results and hence the exposure
analysis. As noted above, there are several other air pollutants that
are not included due to a lack of reliably modelled long-term global
data at the time of writing. ACAG data is currently unavailable in
higher latitudes, so not fully global at the moment and could be an
underrepresentation for some countries.

## Vector borne diseases 

Vector borne disease are human illnesses caused by parasites, viruses,
and bacteria that are transmitted by vectors.

Relevance:

Climate change can alter the distribution and abundance of vectors,
leading to changes in the incidence and geographic range of these
diseases. Higher temperatures combined with land use/land cover change
are making more areas suitable for the transmission of vector-borne
diseases (IPCC, 2022). Children are particularly susceptible to severe
health problems from vector-borne diseases. For instance, malaria can
cause high fever, anemia, and neurological complications, which are
especially dangerous for young children and can also lead to increased
mortality (WHO, 2024). Illnesses can also lead to malnutrition, disrupt
education and affect a child's overall well-being.

Note: While there is various vector borne diseases such as dengue, zika
and others, due to lack of global data availability, only Malaria was
considered for the global child hazard database.

**Malaria**

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to
humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes (WHO,
2021). There are 5Â *Plasmodium*Â parasite species that cause malaria in
humans and 2 of these species --Â *P. falciparum*Â andÂ *P. vivax*Â -- pose
the greatest threat.Â *P. falciparum*Â is the deadliest malaria parasite
and the most prevalent on the African continent.Â *P. vivax*Â is the
dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan
Africa (WHO, 2021).Â 

Data source:

Gridded long-term estimates were downloaded from Malaria Atlas Project
(MAP, 2025) and estimated from the global malariometric data (Pfeffer et
al, 2018)

- Gridded average number of newly diagnosedÂ *Plasmodium
  falciparum*Â cases per 1,000 population from 2012-2022 is used as a
  proxy for the spread of Malaria by Plasmodium falciparum

- Gridded average number of newly diagnosedÂ *Plasmodium vivax*Â cases per
  1,000 population from 2012-2022 is used as a proxy for the spread of
  Malaria by Plasmodium vivax

Data processing:

All children living in areas with more than 1 case is estimated as
children exposed to Malaria (individually calculated for each) and
overlaid with high-resolution gridded global children population layer.
The results were then summarized to different administrative boundaries
as absolute and relative values for all the Member States and
territories using zonal statistics.

Coverage: Global

Indicator:

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to Malaria (Plasmodium
  Falciparum)

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to Malaria (Plasmodium
  Falciparum)

- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to Malaria (Plasmodium
  Vivax)

- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,
  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to Malaria (Plasmodium
  Vivax)

Data limitations:

Due to limitations in data availability, Malaria indicators only include
estimates based on reported cases and does not include areas susceptible
to Malaria based on climate indicators. It is highly recommended to use
a combination of both long-term cases and susceptibility.

# Pixel-level multi-hazard Analysis

This section outlines the process of calculating the multi-hazard
exposure at the pixel level to assess the compounding exposure of child
populations to multiple climate and climate-sensitive hazards.
Pixel-level analysis is performed to capture fine-grained variations in
climate risks within a country, enabling the identification of hotspots
that national averages may overlook. This approach allows for a more
precise understanding of climate risks at both local and national
levels, with the flexibility to aggregate data to administrative levels
0, 1, or 2 based on the specific use case.

**Multi-hazard count**

**Definition and Purpose**

The Multi-hazard Count indicator quantifies the number of distinct
climate and climate-sensitive hazards that are likely to occur in the
same location and overlap with child populations. It is computed at high
spatial resolution (up to 100 meters), allowing for fine-grained
analysis of compounded climate risks.

Each hazard is processed with applied thresholds to identify areas where
its intensity exceeds a meaningful level of risk. These binary hazard
masks are then stacked to calculate, per pixel, the number of different
hazards present. This results in a hazard count map, where pixel values
reflect the number of hazards a given location is exposed to.

To make the indicator child-focused, this multi-hazard count layer is
spatially filtered using high-resolution child population data. The
result is a map that highlights only the areas where children are
present and exposed to one or more hazards. While the pixel values
indicate the number of overlapping hazards, they only appear in
locations with non-zero child population.

height="3.4152154418197727in"}

*Child Population exposure with \>5 hazard count threshold*

**Child-Focused Use Case**

By filtering the hazard count by child population, the indicator serves
as a tool to identify areas where children face compounded climate
risks. It enables targeted planning for health, education, and
protection interventions, and supports more equitable resource
allocation.

**Aggregation and Applications**

The pixel-level results can be aggregated to administrative units (e.g.,
district, province) to calculate:

- Total number of children exposed to one or more hazards

- Number of children exposed to 1, 2, 3, 4 or more concurrent hazards

- Distribution of hazard count among children within a region

This indicator supports decision-making in disaster risk reduction,
climate adaptation, and child-focused program design.

**Multi-hazard intensity**

**Definition and Purpose**

The Multi-Hazard Intensity indicator evaluates not only whether a
location is exposed to hazards, but how severe or extreme those hazards
are. This high-resolution metric---computed at approximately 10 km
spatial resolution---integrates the magnitudes of various climate and
climate-sensitive hazards into a composite risk score for each location.
Unlike a simple count of hazard types, this indicator distinguishes
between areas experiencing frequent but moderate events and those
exposed to less frequent but highly destructive climate extremes.

By capturing intensity, this metric offers a more nuanced understanding
of risk, enabling local governments, humanitarian actors, and climate
resilience planners to better prioritize areas that face more severe
threats---even if only from one or two dominant hazards.

**Data Processing:**

Each hazard layer---such as heatwave frequency, drought severity, or
flood intensity---is first cleaned and normalized to ensure
comparability across different hazard types. This process involves
removing non-informative values (e.g., zeros, NaNs), resampling to a
consistent 10 km grid using a maximum-value method (to preserve peaks),
and applying log transformations followed by z-score scaling to
standardize the distributions. Pre-scaled datasets like SPI or soil
moisture anomaly are directly included after trimming outliers to
improve distribution symmetry.

Once the data layers are harmonized, they are stacked into a
multi-dimensional array, where each pixel holds values representing the
magnitude of different hazards. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
then used to reduce this complex dataset to its most informative
components---capturing over 90% of total variance with just 11 principal
components. These components provide a way to synthesize multiple hazard
signals while preserving key differences between regions.

From the PCA results, a weighted combination of principal component
loadings---informed by each component\'s explained variance---is used to
derive a final composite hazard intensity score for each land pixel.
This produces a raw indicator of multi-hazard intensity, which is then
normalized to a 0--10 scale using min-max scaling. The final result is a
single raster layer where each valid land pixel carries a score
representing the cumulative severity of climate risks in that location.

**Child Population Exposure Estimate**

The thresholds are applied to categorize child populations based on
different levels of climate risk exposure. The child population exposure
is calculated at various risk thresholds, such as the mean and
percentiles, to estimate the number of children affected at different
risk levels.

![](./media/image6.png){width="5.6952712160979875in"
height="3.143351924759405in"}

*Child Population exposure with 90 percentile Threshold*

**Child-Focused Application**

To center the metric on children, the composite intensity surface is
overlaid with high-resolution child population data. This overlay allows
for the estimation of the number of children exposed to varying levels
of climate hazard severity---from average exposure to the top 1% of most
at-risk zones. For example, over 1.7 billion children globally are
exposed to areas exceeding the mean hazard intensity value, while nearly
19 million are in areas above the 99th percentile of severity.

This approach highlights not only where the most intense risks occur but
also who is affected---making it a powerful tool for guiding investments
in child protection, school infrastructure resilience, and health
services. It also allows for threshold-based analysis, helping
governments and agencies understand the scale of exposure at critical
risk levels (e.g., above the 90th percentile).

**Sensitivity and Limitations**

The method allows for robust sensitivity testing, including the effect
of resampling strategies, the number of PCA components used, and
alternative normalization approaches. However, it also carries
assumptions---such as the linearity of PCA and the weighting of
components---which must be carefully validated in different contexts.

Despite these limitations, the Multi-Hazard Intensity metric offers a
scalable, data-driven approach to understanding where high-severity
climate risks intersect with vulnerable populations---a critical step
toward effective and equitable climate resilience planning.

# Child Vulnerability

Children face unique vulnerabilities that make them particularly
susceptible to climate and climate-sensitive hazards. Given their unique
metabolism, physiology, and developmental needs, children are more
vulnerable to extreme events and societal changes than adults.
Additionally, children are less able to protect themselves from harm and
are more dependent on adults for their safety and care. Addressing these
vulnerabilities is crucial for creating resilient and supportive
environments that promote children\'s growth and development.

## Health

Three sub-components are considered under health: child health, maternal
health and access to electricity with four indicators.

**Child health:**

Immunization is one of the most cost-effective public health
interventions. The first dose of the
diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP1) serves as a proxy
for access to immunization services, while coverage of the third dose
(DTP3) is often used as an indicator of how effectively countries are
delivering routine immunization services to children (a good proxy for
child health). Access to life-saving vaccines to combat diseases is not
universal and varies across regions and countries
([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/immunization/)).

Indicators:

- Â Percentage of surviving infants\* who received the first dose of
  DTP-containing vaccine

- Â Percentage of surviving infants who received the third dose of
  DTP-containing vaccine

\*Live-born infants who survive long enough to be eligible for
vaccination [Survive and thrive: transforming care for every small and
sick newborn](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241515887)

Coverage: Data is available for 195 countries and territories.

Source: WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC),
2023 revision

Data Limitations: WUENIC is informed by reported administrative data and
household surveys, both of which can have limitations including
incomplete reporting, misclassification or biases. When data gaps,
inconsistencies without explanation or unreliable data exist, WUENIC
uses various statistical methods such as interpolation or extrapolation,
which may not accurately reflect the reality on the ground. The most
recent year estimates are informed by less data as surveys for the
youngest cohorts are not available.

**Maternal health:**

Despite recent progress, millions of births still occur without any
assistance from a skilled attendant each year which is a good proxy for
maternal health in a country.

Indicator: Percentage of deliveries attended by skilled health personnel

Coverage: Data is available for [192]{.mark} countries and territories.

Source: Joint UNICEF-WHO Database on Skilled Birth Attendance 2024.

Data Limitations: This indicator measures the extent to which the health
system can support mothers during childbirth; however, it alone doesn't
show whether delivery care is actually available or accessible when
needed and the quality of delivery care being provided. Another
limitation is related to the standardization of the 'skilled' health
personnel across all countries and regions as different countries use
different job titles for healthcare workers. In some areas, duties are
shifted from trained professionals to less experienced staff which can
affect the accuracy of the data collected.Â 

**Health system performance:**

Electrification is a proxy of health system performance, that strongly
correlates to a variety of other covariates, and access to basic
utilities like electricity can enhance the operation of healthcare
facilities and services, impacting outcomes like ANC4 and skilled
attendance at births.

Indicator: Percentage of population with access to electricity

Coverage: Data is available for 212 countries and territories.

Source: World Bank

Data Limitations: The indicator only measures whether people have access
to electricity or not which is usually defined as the ability to connect
to the official grid provided by the industry. It does not consider
quality (voltage fluctuations), reliability (blackouts) or duration
(number of hours per day electricity is available). Besides, it does not
measure whether people can afford to use electricity once they have
access. In many countries, people use off-grid sources (solar panels,
private small-scale grids) or informal connections which might not be
officially registered leading to underreporting of the data.Â 

## Nutrition

Two indicators are considered under Nutrition: Stunting and Child food
poverty

**Stunting**Â is the result of chronic or recurrent undernutrition
in-utero and early childhood. Children suffering from stunting may never
reach their full possible height nor their full cognitive potential.
Stunted children not only earn less as adults as a result of less
schooling and learning difficulties when in school, but they are also
more likely to be at risk of overweight and obesity than children of
normal height
([Source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/child-nutrition/)).

Indicator: Prevalence of stunting (height for age \<-2 standard
deviation from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child
Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age

Coverage: Data is available for [163]{.mark} countries and territories.

Source: UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates
Expanded Database: Stunting (Survey Estimates) 2023.

Data Limitations: Survey estimates have uncertainty due to both sampling
error and non-sampling error (e.g., measurement technical error,
recording error, etc.). The JME modelled estimates for stunting take
into account estimates of sampling error around survey estimates. While
non-sampling error cannot be accounted for or reviewed in full, when
available, a data quality review of weight, height and age data from
household surveys supports compilation of a time series that is
comparable across countries over time.

**Child food poverty** is a distinct metric that refers to a child's
inability to access and consume a nutritious and diverse diet in early
childhood. It is measured using UNICEF and WHO dietary diversity scores.
Children are defined as living in severe child food poverty if they
consume foods from two or fewer food groups out of eight food groups
([Source](https://www.unicef.org/reports/child-food-poverty)).

Indicator: Percentage of children 6--23 months of age consuming foods
and beverages from zero, one or two out of eight defined food groups1
during the previous day (severe child food poverty)

Coverage: Data is available for 108 countries and territories.

Source: UNICEF Global Database on Infant and Young Child Feeding. Child
food poverty, December 2023.

Data Limitations: As household surveys are the primary source of data on
child food poverty, the estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to
both sampling and non-sampling error (e.g. misclassification of food
items in food groups, recording error etc.).

## WASH

Securing access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene reduces
illness and death, especially among children and it is critical for
their survival and growth. Three indicators are considered under WASH.

**Water**

At least basic drinking water refers to water from an improved source,
provided collection time is not more than 30 minutes for a round trip,
including queuing
([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/drinking-water/))
where the improved sources must be accessible on premises, available
when needed and free from contamination.

Indicator: Proportion of population using improved drinking water
sources no more than 30 mins roundtrip

Coverage: Data is available for 207 countries and territories

Source: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme -- WASH in households 2023
update.

**Sanitation**

At least basic sanitation refers to use of improved facilities that are
not shared with other households
([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/sanitation/))
and has a 'safely managed' service, excreta must either be safely
disposed of in situ or removed and treated offsite.

Indicator: Proportion of population using improved sanitation facilities
not shared with other households

Coverage: Data is available for 206 countries and territories.

Source: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme -- WASH in households 2023
update.

**Hygiene**

Basic hygiene refers to availability of a handwashing facility with soap
and water at home
([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/hygiene/)).

Indicator: Proportion of population with a handwashing facility with
soap and water available at home

Coverage: Data is available for 84 countries and territories.

Source: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme -- WASH in households 2023
update.

Data Limitations for WASH: JMP produces internationally comparable
estimates based on national data sources. Estimates are modelled using
all available data points and at-least basic is preferred over safely
managed (SDG indicators) due to data availability.

## Education

The education and training that children receive in secondary school
equip them with skills that are necessary to fully participate in
society. Though the duration in each country varies, secondary education
typically covers ages 12 to 17 and is divided into two levels: lower
secondary education (spanning 3 to 4 years) and upper secondary
education (spanning 2 to 3 years). Although notable progress has been
made in the past few decades, challenges remain in reducing regional
disparities and inequalities among secondary school-age students from
different socioeconomic backgrounds.
([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/education/secondary-education/)).

Three indicators are considered under education: Lower secondary out of
school rate, lower secondary completion rate and learning poverty.

**Lower secondary out of school**

Indicator: Percentage of children out of school in lower secondary
education

Coverage: Data is available for 115 countries and territories.

Source: UNICEF global databases, 2024, based on DHS, MICS and other
national surveys.

Data Limitations: The main limitation lies in the data sources.
Administrative records are not well-suited to capture out-of-school
populations, as they only include children who are registered within the
education system. The recommended approach is to estimate out-of-school
rates using household survey data. However, such surveys are not always
conducted regularly or widely---particularly in countries or regions
with high rates of children not attending school.

**Lower secondary completion rate**

Percentage of cohort of children or young people three to five years
older than the intended age for the last grade of lower secondary
education who have completed that level of education.

Indicator: Completion rate of children in lower secondary education

Coverage: Data is available for 112 countries and territories.

Source: UNICEF global databases, 2024, based on DHS, MICS and other
national surveys.

Data Limitations: A key limitation of this indicator is that it measures
school completion 3--5 years after the expected age of graduation. As a
result, it can only be calculated when at least three years have passed
since a child was expected to complete a given level of education.

**Learning poverty**

The learning poverty indicator was launched by the World Bank and the
UNESCO Institute for Statistics in 2019 helps to better understand the
global learning crisis. High rates of learning poverty are an early
signal that education systems are failing to ensure that children
develop critical foundational skills
([source](https://www.unicef.org/media/122921/file/StateofLearningPoverty2022.pdf)).

Indicator: Rate of learning poverty

Coverage: Data is available for 122 countries and territories.

Source: UNICEF global databases, 2024, based on DHS, MICS and other
national surveys.

Data Limitations: While this indicator effectively combines two critical
aspects of education---school access and learning outcomes---it is
significantly limited by the availability and coverage of data on
learning outcomes. In many cases, these data are either outdated,
infrequent, or not representative, which restricts the robustness of the
measure.

## Protection

Two indicators are considered under Child Protection: Child labor and
Child marriage

**Child labor**

Children around the world are routinely engaged in paid and unpaid forms
of work that are not harmful to them. However, they are classified as
child labourers when they are either too young to work or are involved
in hazardous activities that may compromise their physical, mental,
social or educational development. A child is considered to be involved
in child labour under the following conditions: (a) children 5--11 years
old who, during the reference week, did at least one hour of economic
activity and/or more than 21 hours of unpaid household services, (b)
children 12--14 years old who, during the reference week, did at least
14 hours of economic activity and/or more than 21 hours of unpaid
household services, (c) children 15--17 years old who, during the
reference week, did at least 43 hours of economic activity.

Indicator: Percentage of children 5--17 years old involved in child
labour

Coverage: Data is available for [85]{.mark} countries and territories.

Source: UNICEF global databases, 2024, based on DHS, MICS and other
national surveys.

Data Limitations: While the concept of child labour includes working in
activities that are hazardous in nature, to ensure comparability of
estimates over time and to minimize data quality issues, work beyond
age-specific hourly thresholds is used as a proxy for hazardous work.
Further methodological work is needed to validate questions specifically
aimed at identifying children in hazardous working conditions.
Similarly, the worst forms of child labour are not currently captured in
regular household surveys given difficulties in accurately and reliably
measuring them. In addition, 'own use production of goods', including
activities such as fetching water and collecting firewood, have been
classified as unpaid household services (i.e., household chores).
(UNICEF, 2020).

**Child Marriage**

Marriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation of human
rights. Many factors interact to placing a child at risk of marriage,
including poverty, the perception that marriage will provide
'protection', family honor, social norms, customary or religious laws
that condone the practice, an inadequate legislative framework and the
state of a country's civil registration system. While the practice is
more common among girls than boys, it is a violation of rights
regardless of sex
([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/child-marriage/)).

Indicator: Total number of girls and women of all ages who were first
married or in union before age 18

Coverage: Data is available for 140 countries and territories.

Source: UNICEF global databases, 2024, based on DHS, MICS and other
national surveys.

Data Limitations: The measure of child marriage is retrospective in
nature by design, capturing age at first marriage among a population
that has completed the risk period (i.e., adult women). Thus, there is
an inherent time lag between the moment at which child marriages occur
and when they show up in the data: Prevalence estimates reflect child
marriages that occurred at least two years and as many as six or more
years prior to the reported year. While it is also possible to measure
the current marital status of girls under age 18, such measures would
provide an underestimation of the level of child marriage, as girls who
are not currently married may still do so before they turn 18 (UNICEF,
2020).

## Poverty

**Multi-dimensional poverty**

Child poverty measures the means (or the lack thereof) to realize child
rights that crucially and directly rely on continuously/periodically
using material elements such as goods and services. These rights include
clothing, education, health, housing, information, nutrition, play,
sanitation, and water. The lack of these basic needs often results in
deficits that cannot easily be overcome later in life. Even when not
clearly deprived, having poorer opportunities than their peers in any of
the above can limit future opportunities
([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-poverty/overview/)).

Indicator: Percentage of children with severe material deprivation

Coverage: Data is available for 72 countries and territories.

Source: UNICEF global databases

Data Limitations: To ensure international comparability and to be able
to aggregate across countries, the indicators and thresholds used to
establish severe deprivation do not necessarily coincide with more
nuanced and appropriate measures at the national level.

**Under five covered by social protection**

Social protection is a set of measures that allows all members of
society to access essential health care and provides them with income
security. Child-sensitive social protection systems -- programs such as
cash transfers, health insurance and education subsidies -- can help
make sure that no child is left behind because of poverty. But globally,
few children benefit. For almost three out of every four children,
social protection programs remain out of reach
([source](http://unicef.org/innocenti/areas-of-work/child-poverty-and-social-protection)).

Indicator: Percentage of children under 5 covered by social protection

Coverage: Data is available for 182 countries and territories.

Source: UNSD SDG Database

Data Limitations: This indicator only includes cash transfers, and not
all elements of social protection.

## Child Survival

**Under five mortality**

The under-five mortality rate refers to the probability a newborn would
die before reaching exactly 5 years of age, expressed per 1,000 live
births
([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality/)).

Indicator: Mortality rate under five per 1000 live births

Coverage: Data is available for 199 countries and territories.

Source: UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation

Data Limitations: Under-5 mortality data, while crucial, often faces
limitations such as varying reporting standards and data collection
methodologies across different countries. Additionally, the data may not
always capture the specific causes of death at a granular level or
adequately reflect localized disparities within countries.

# Children Climate Risk Index (CCRI)

## Background

In 2021, UNICEF released the first global Children Climate Risk Index
(CCRI) that identified the countries that are most-at risk for both
climate and environmental hazards -- estimating that one billion
children live in countries facing extreme risks to their ability to
survive, grow and thrive. In 2023, UNICEF released the Sustainability
and Climate Change Action Plan (SCAP) galvanizing a global commitment to
ensure a sustainable world and protect the most vulnerable children and
in 2024 a new Climate and Environment data unit was established to
enable easy access to data, analysis for global, regional and
country-level applications by developing a global child hazard database
and updating the CCRI. Following extensive internal and external
consultations, CCRI was revised and updated using the best available
global hazard and vulnerability data to better understand the extent of
vulnerable children's exposure to climate and climate-sensitive hazards.

CCRI is a composite index that aims to rank countries where vulnerable
children are also exposed to a wide range of climate and environmental
hazards. Recognizing that children are disproportionately affected by
these hazards, CCRI provides a comprehensive assessment of how climate
and environmental hazards intersect with children's existing
vulnerabilities.

## Theoretical Framework

CCRI 2025 adopted the hazard x exposure x vulnerability as the
foundational risk framework (IPCC, 2020).

- **Risk** refers to the potential of adverse consequences, resulting
  from dynamic interactions between climate-related hazards with the
  exposure and vulnerability of children or associated assets and
  systems to the hazards.

- **Hazards** refer to the potential occurrence of climate and
  climate-sensitive hazards that can cause adverse effects to children

- **Exposure** refers to presence of children that could be adversely
  affected by hazards

- **Vulnerability** refers to existing deprivations that are specific to
  children

Hazards, exposure and vulnerability may each be subject to uncertainty
in terms of magnitude and likelihood of occurrence, and each may change
over time and space due to socio-economic changes and human
decision-making. CCRI 2025, similar to the earlier version, summarizes
risk analysis into two critical pillars with components, sub-components
and indicators:

- **Pillar 1** looks at **children's exposure to climate hazards** such
  as riverine and coastal floods, tropical storms, droughts, heatwaves,
  sand & dust storms, fires and climate-sensitive hazards such as air
  pollution and vector borne diseases.

- **Pillar 2** considers the inherent **vulnerabilities of children** in
  WASH, nutrition, protection, health, education, poverty and child
  survival.

By integrating the two pillars, CCRI provides a powerful framework to
understand the specific risks that children face. Understanding these
complex interactions is crucial to better prepare, mitigate and adapt to
the rapidly evolving climate crisis. This data-driven tool is aimed to
allow UNICEF country offices, policy makers, humanitarian organizations,
and other relevant stakeholders to advocate, prioritize action and
allocate resources effectively to protect the most vulnerable children,
building a climate resilient future for all. Work is underway to develop
global indicators for monitoring adaptation to climate change[^1] and
these could potentially be included as a third pillar in future
iterations of CCRI.

Each pillar in CCRI 2025 consists of components, sub-components (where
needed) and indicators.

In CCRI 2025, climate and climate-sensitive hazards refer to those
hazards that are directly or indirectly influenced by Earth's climate
system. There is no universal classification available, and the
following definitions are adopted for the purpose of CCRI 2025.

**Climate hazard** refers to natural events that are pre-dominantly
hydro-meteorological in nature such as floods, tropical storms,
heatwaves, wildfires and droughts. These hazards can be exacerbated by
climate change, leading to increased frequency, intensity, and
unpredictability (IPCC, 2022).

**Climate sensitive hazard** refers to hazards such as air pollution and
vector borne diseases that are sensitive to changes in climate patterns,
such as temperature and precipitation, which can affect the distribution
and intensity of these risks (IPCC, 2022).

Understanding climate hazards is core to risk analysis, emergency
preparedness and planning for effective mitigation and adaptation.
Pillar 1 combines children's exposure to multiple hazards where open,
global data was available. *Please note that the list of climate and
climate-sensitive hazards is not comprehensive, and other relevant
hazards might not have been included due to lack of global data
availability.*

*Fig 1: CCRI 2025 Theoretical Framework*

**What is new in CCRI 2025?**

- CCRI 2025 focuses more on climate and climate-sensitive hazards
  whereas CCRI 2021 included a mix of climate and environmental hazards.
  Since the list of hazards and the underlying datasets are different,
  the two indices are not comparable.

- CCRI 2025 also estimates the index by country as well as gridded
  analysis, pinpointing the hotspot areas where vulnerable children are
  exposed to multiple extreme hazard events in all countries

- CCRI 2025 includes the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) which
  were omitted from CCRI 2021 due to lack of data availability at that
  time.

- CCRI 2025 also regroups sub-components of the child vulnerability
  pillar to align with UNICEF programmes, making poverty and child
  survival as separate components, as well as splitting health and
  nutrition into separate components.

**What is not included in CCRI 2025?**

- CCRI 2025 does not include attribution (linking directly to
  anthropogenic climate hazards) but identifies children's exposure to
  all hazards. In other words, it is not quantifying the impact of
  human-induced climate change on children separately from naturally
  occurring extreme weather events.

- CCRI 2025 does not look at how climate and climate-sensitive hazards
  increases vulnerability but at where vulnerable children are exposed
  to these hazards.

- CCRI 2025 does not include analysis on future projections of climate
  risks on children, given the uncertainty in available projections and
  child population. There are no reliable, modelled estimates available
  for future child vulnerability.

- CCRI 2025 does not include all the possible relevant indicators on
  climate and climate-sensitive hazards, only those for which open,
  quantifiable, spatially distributed global data are available.

- CCRI 2025 does not include any predictions.

**How to interpret CCRI 2025?**

Interpreting the CCRI requires understanding its multifaceted nature as
a composite index. It should be interpreted not merely as a measure of
how many hazards children are exposed to, but as a comprehensive
indicator of the overall risks they face. A higher CCRI score signifies
not just higher exposure, but also a diminished capacity to cope with
and recover from these shocks due to underlying deprivations. This
holistic perspective highlights regions and populations where both
proactive climate action and urgent investments in strengthening
child-centered services are most critically needed to build resilience
and safeguard children\'s futures.

**Pillar 1: Children Exposure to Hazards**

With 10 components and 30 indicators, Pillar 1 aggregates absolute and
relative exposure to individual hazard at a country level. The 10
hazards include:

1.  Flood -- Riverine

2.  Flood -- Coastal

3.  Drought -- Agricultural, Meteorological

4.  Tropical Storm

5.  Heatwaves (frequency, intensity, duration)

6.  Extreme heat

7.  Sand and Dust Storm

8.  Fire (frequency, intensity)

9.  Air Pollution

10. Vector-Borne Diseases

![A screenshot of a computer screen AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image8.png){width="6.331563867016623in"
height="3.7916666666666665in"}

Individual dimensions are aggregated separately. Refer to the Global
Hazard [Data
catalog](https://unicef.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/DAPM/Ea7VSfMuwJxOn4XYMFIVW6oBOlaFsu61lMlpFcvcoBDgeg?e=HiM2WR)
to download the full metadata for all hazard layers.

**Considerations for Hazard Indicators:**

- Probabilistic models were given higher priority to define hazards that
  could potentially happen at any given point at any given time.

- A 100-year return period is considered as default which signifies an
  event that is both probable, impactful, and likely to happen within a
  child's lifetime.

- Where there is a lack of probabilistic models, long-term observation
  data has been chosen as a proxy to estimate both absolute and relative
  children exposure.

- The number of years considered varies from hazard to hazard, depending
  on the data availability and to compensate for the influence of
  climate change.

- It is to note that the estimates include all children who could
  potentially be exposed to a particular hazard and do not account for
  exposure in any particular year.

**Components of Pillar 2: Child Vulnerability**

Pillar 2 includes 7 child-specific vulnerability components with 17
indicators:

1.  Health

2.  Nutrition

3.  WASH

4.  Education

5.  Protection

6.  Poverty

7.  Child Survival

![](./media/image9.png){width="5.715277777777778in"
height="3.5889523184601924in"}

**Considerations for vulnerability indicators:**

- Child vulnerability indicators were chosen after extensive internal
  consultations with sector-specific and data experts. While there are
  over 50 child vulnerability indicators, for the purpose of CCRI 2025,
  17 are considered across seven components.

- All vulnerability indicators are considered at country level and the
  last available data has been assumed to be current.

- All definitions and data on child vulnerability are obtained from
  data.unicef.org.

- Each indicator that is added increases complexity and reduces
  coverage. Efforts have been made to conduct extensive sensitivity
  analysis to best combine individual indicators and components.

- When a particular indicator is not available for a country, it is not
  considered in the average where the weights of individual indicators
  are not evenly applied. Since the indicators are highly correlated,
  our sensitivity analysis have limited to no impact on the final score.

- A combination of indicators showing vulnerability and where data
  unavailable, proxies using lack of coping capacity is used

## Methodology

CCRI composite index is designed to encompass a comprehensive list of
children's exposure to various hazards and vulnerabilities. Each pillar
is processed separately with an internally established semi-automated
data pipeline and follows multiple steps.

**Data Preparation**

For pillar 1 hazard data, raw raster data collected from various
established data sources is processed using Google Earth Engine. Raster
data is first uploaded as an Image Collection asset representing each
hazard. Image Collections are processed into a single layer by spatially
assembling into a continuous image using mosaicking. All raster tiles
are merged and clipped to represent global land boundaries using
coastline layer and as discussed earlier 100-year return period is used
for probabilistic models and the most recent ten- year average of
long-term observations.

For pillar 2, all indicators are downloaded using UNICEF's Data
Warehouse -- [SDMX](https://sdmx.data.unicef.org/overview.html) API.

**Thresholding**

For pillar 1 hazard data, thresholds are chosen based on existing
literature and expert feedback. Meticulous steps were taken to widely
consult with the external experts and review the most recent
state-of-the-art research available. It is important to note that by
choosing global thresholds, it is possible to over- or under-estimate
the exposure of children to individual hazards. The following table
highlights the thresholds used for individual hazards

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Hazard**       **Threshold**                         **Notes**
  ---------------- ------------------------------------- ----------------

  Malaria          \>1 case per 1000 population          
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Overlay and Summarizing**

For pillar 1 hazard data, using Worldpop's gridded child population
layer, both the absolute (total number of children) and relative
(percentage of children) exposure of children are calculated for every
hazard using a simple overlay technique. Zonal statistics is used to
summarize the total and percentage of children exposed by countries and
territories.

**Imputation of Missing Values**

Imputation is a statistical technique used to estimate and fill in
missing values within a dataset.

All indicators used in CCRI are chosen on the basis of the six
established criteria, but most indicators still lack global coverage and
are not regularly updated every year. This results in a significant
number of missing values. As well known in literature, composite
indicators do not necessarily require imputation of missing values
within a component score if the indicators have high correlation
([source](https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/inform-index/Portals/0/InfoRM/Publications/EUR%2030037%20-%20Imputation%20of%20missing%20values%20in%20the%20INFORM%20Global%20Risk%20Index%20-%20print.pdf)).

For CCRI 2025, our primary approach is a pre-imputation process where if
data for most recent year was not available, the most recent data from
the past ten years were considered. The next approach is a complete case
analysis, or case deletion. This means that if a particular record
(e.g., for a specific country or sub-national unit) has at least 75% of
its data points missing for the vulnerability variables being analyzed,
that entire record is excluded from the analysis. This approach is
aligned with international best practices and guidance from both the
OECD Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators (OECD, 2008) and the
INFORM Risk Index Methodology (European Commission, 2023).

It is crucial to acknowledge the inherent limitation of this method:
this approach risks ignoring potential systematic differences between
the complete and incomplete samples and we recognize that this could
lead to results that do not fully represent the entire population or all
geographic areas. Sensitivity analysis is given below and as shown with
high correlation there is relatively less to no impact of missing data
on final index scores.

**Thresholds for missing vulnerability indicators/sensitivity
analysis**Â 

We conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to evaluate how the
combined Pillar 1 (exposure) and Pillar 2 (development indicators)
rankings of countries respond to varying levels of missing data. By
iteratively applying thresholds from 0.1 to 0.9 for the minimum
proportion of available Pillar 2 indicators, we computed geometric and
arithmetic averages, merged them with Pillar 1 scores, and ranked
countries at each threshold.Â Â 

![A graph of a graph of lines AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image10.png){width="5.566666666666666in"
height="3.889759405074366in"}Â 

Â We then tracked rank stability in two ways: first, for countries fully
available at the highest threshold (0.9), confirming that their relative
rankings remain stable even when the threshold is lowered; and second,
for newly added countries appearing at lower thresholds (e.g., 0.8),

We focused on the 0.9 threshold to track countries with the most
complete Pillar 2 data and assess ranking stability. By examining
relative ranks within this cohort, we could determine whether lowering
the threshold affected the positions of countries already
well-represented, ensuring that rank changes reflect genuine sensitivity
rather than simply the addition of new countries with more missing
data.Â

For newly added countries appearing at lower thresholds (e.g., 0.8), we
observed that their ranks also remained stable, confirming that the
imputation method and averaging approach maintained consistent relative
positions even as more countries were included.Â

Finally, we quantified rank disruptions across thresholds within cohorts
by calculating average, maximum, and percentage of rank changes.
Finally, we quantified rank disruptions across thresholds within cohorts
by calculating the average, maximum, and percentage of rank changes.
This step measures how much the relative ordering of countries shifts
when the minimum valid data threshold is lowered. The fact that all
these values came out as zeros indicates that, within each cohort, the
ranks remained completely stable: lowering the threshold did not alter
the relative positions of countries that were already included. This
reinforces the conclusion that our method of averaging available Pillar
2 variables provides robust rankings, and that missing data at lower
thresholds does not distort the relative standings of the countries.Â \
Â \
However, the stable relative ranks across cohorts and thresholds do not
necessarily imply that this method of imputation is perfect, as it may
still mask biases or underestimate uncertainty in countries with more
missing data.Â

Â As shown in the below heatmap, most of the vulnerability indicators are
moderately to highly correlated. This pattern shows that the mean
imputation that we are using is working well: when variables are
correlated, missing values can be reasonably inferred from the other
available indicators, so the relative ranks of countries remain stable
across thresholds.Â Â

**Final version with chosen TH of missing value and with on climate
variables**Â 

Using 0.5 as a threshold for missing vulnerability indicator and
filtering out countries where the area is smaller than 20000 square
kilometers. This leaves 149 countries in the final results with CCRI
score and rank.Â Â 

**Normalization**

Normalization is a statistical technique to adjust data from different
sources to a common scale without distorting differences in the ranges
of values. This ensures that all variables contribute equally to the
final index. Common methods include min-max normalization, where data is
scaled to a range of 0 to 1, and z-score normalization, which adjusts
data based on the mean and standard deviation.

In CCRI 2025, the values are normalized using the min-max technique to a
0-10 scale for all indicators, components and pillars. Min-Max
normalizes indicators to an identical range by subtracting the minimum
value and dividing by the range of the indicator values, noting that
extreme values/or outliers could distort the transformed indicator. But
one notable advantage is that it could widen the range of indicators
lying within a small interval, increasing the effect on the composite
indicator.

The min and max values are considered where skewness is lower than 2 AND
kurtosis is lower than 3.5. Skewness and kurtosis are calculated
iteratively for the whole dataset without the obvious outliers, until
pre-set conditions are met. The minimum and maximum data point of the
remaining dataset are taken as min and max.

Normalized indicator score (0-10): 10 - (baseline maximum -- raw data
value) / (baseline maximum -- baseline minimum) x 10

To ensure a similar trend in normalization for all indicators, where
higher values show worse conditions, 10 of the vulnerability indicators
have been reversed as highlighted in the table below.

**Aggregation**

Aggregation involves combining multiple indicators or data points into a
single composite score. This step typically uses weighted averages or
other statistical methods to summarize the data.Â Aggregation helps in
simplifying complex data sets into a more understandable and actionable
format

CCRI 2025 uses a blended aggregation method using both geometric and
arithmetic average.

TheÂ **arithmetic mean**Â is the sum of a set of values divided by the
number of values. It is the most common measure of central tendency and
is easy to calculate and understand. However, it can be heavily
influenced by outliers, which can skew the mean and give a misleading
representation of the data set. It is best used when the data is
symmetrically distributed without extreme values and where there is
compensability between the indicators.

TheÂ **geometric mean**Â is the nth root of the product of n values. It is
particularly useful for data sets with values that are multiplicative or
vary exponentially, such as growth rates. The geometric mean is less
affected by extreme values compared to the arithmetic mean, providing a
more accurate measure for skewed distributions. However, it is more
complex to calculate and interpret, and it cannot be used with data sets
containing zero or negative values.

**Log transformation**Â is a mathematical technique used to convert data
to a logarithmic scale. This transformation helps in stabilizing
variance, making the data more normally distributed, and reducing the
impact of outliers. It is particularly useful for data sets with a wide
range of values or exponential growth patterns.

Geometric mean is used to aggregate at pillar level, as well as to
aggregate relative and absolute exposure to individual hazard components
in Pillar 1. Arithmetic mean is used where we have two indicators that
show compensability and used to aggregate the indicators and components
in Pillar 2. By adopting a blended method, CCRI can capture both the
compounding effects of hazards as well as the independent effects of
each vulnerability indicator.

Any future improvements in any of the indicators will directly influence
the index.

If there are no values for a specific indicator, it is not counted
towards the aggregation. For pillar 1 hazard layers, all pixels with no
values are assumed to be no hazard.

**Correlation and sensitivity analysis**

**Assessing Alignment Between CCRI P1 and Spatial Multi-Hazard Risk**

This analysis explores whether countries with high scores on UNICEF's
CCRI P1 component---which reflects child exposure to multiple climate
hazards---also rank highly when using gridded data on hazard intensity
and the number of overlapping hazards. Using high-resolution population
and hazard data, we calculated the number of children exposed by country
and compared the results with CCRI P1 rankings. The comparison showed a
strong correlation: for example, the Spearman correlation between CCRI
P1 and multi-hazard intensity exposure was Ï = 0.817 (p \< 0.001), and
the Kendall rank correlation was Ï = 0.664 (p \< 0.001). These results
confirm that CCRI P1 aligns well with independent, spatially detailed
measures of climate risk, while also showing the added value of
high-resolution analysis.

height="3.8003291776027996in"}

**Comparison of CCRI P2 with Global Development and Risk Indices**

In the first part of the analysis, we compared CCRI P2 values---which
reflect a country's adaptive capacity, vulnerability, and access to
services relevant to children---with two well-known global indices: the
ND-GAIN Country Index and the Human Development Index (HDI). The
comparison shows a very strong positive correlation (P = 0.86),
indicating that countries scoring low on child-specific resilience
factors tend to also perform poorly in broader climate adaptation and
human development metrics.

In the second part, we compared the overall CCRI score (combining P1 and
P2 components) with the INFORM Risk Index, a widely used measure of
disaster risk. This comparison also showed a strong positive correlation
(P = 0.8), supporting the validity of CCRI as a comprehensive tool to
assess climate and disaster-related risks to children. These findings
reinforce that CCRI is not only aligned with established indices but
also offers added child-specific granularity for policy and
planning.![undefined](./media/image17.jpg){width="3.9706660104986877in"
height="4.034722222222222in"}

**CCRI P2 vs ND-GAIN & HDI**\
*"Countries with low child resilience (CCRI P2) also show low climate
adaptation (ND-GAIN) and human development (HDI) capacity --- P = 0.86"*

![undefined](./media/image18.jpeg){width="3.7569444444444446in"
height="3.8175535870516186in"}

**CCRI (P1+P2) vs INFORM Risk Index**\
*"Overall child climate risk aligns closely with INFORM's broader
disaster risk assessment --- P = 0.8"*

**Composite Index**

Index generation is the final step where normalized and aggregated data
are combined to produce a comprehensive risk index. This involves
calculating a composite score that represents the overall climate risk
for children. The index can be used to compare different regions or
populations, identify high-risk areas, and inform policy decisions. The
process includes validating the index through statistical analysis and
expert review to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

CCRI composite index also uses a 0-10 scale, where 10 represents the
highest multi-hazard risk.

**Key Considerations and Limitations of the Database**

It\'s important to understand the following considerations and
limitations when interpreting the data presented in this database:

- **CCRI Scope:** The Children\'s Climate Risk Index (CCRI) quantifies
  the compounded risk children face by identifying those who are already
  vulnerable (due to factors like poverty or lack of access to essential
  services) and simultaneously exposed to climate-related hazards. It
  does not, however, directly quantify the overall economic or social
  impact of climate change.

- **Population Data:** The population estimates, including all 2024
  figures derived from WorldPop data, are subject to the inherent
  limitations of that dataset. These limitations specifically apply to
  population estimates and often do not account for dynamic population
  movements, such as internal migration or displacement. It might also
  not fully match with national estimates, especially if the census is
  quite outdated.

- **Hazard Data Characteristics:** It\'s important to distinguish
  between hazard data types: some hazards are represented by
  probabilistic models (e.g., future flood likelihood), while others are
  based on historical observations (e.g., past drought events). This
  distinction influences their interpretation.

- **Data Gaps in Hazard Coverage:** While striving for comprehensive
  coverage, certain critical hazards, despite their relevance, currently
  lack globally available, open-source data that meets the necessary
  standards for inclusion in this database. These are noted where
  applicable.

- **Vulnerability Measurement Challenges:** While critical for a
  holistic understanding of risk, some dimensions of vulnerability are
  inherently difficult to measure consistently across diverse countries.
  This presents a challenge for their inclusion in a standardized global
  measure, leading to a focus on indicators with greater cross-country
  comparability.

- **Vulnerability Data Handling and Sub-national Limitations:**
  Information on the number of countries with available survey data for
  specific vulnerability dimensions, along with detailed explanations of
  how missing data are managed (e.g., complete case analysis, where
  records with at least 75% missing data are omitted, with
  acknowledgement of potential biases), is provided in relevant
  sections. It is also important to note any specific limitations
  regarding the availability or granularity of sub-national
  vulnerability data.

- **Nature of Estimates:** The hazard data presented comprises global
  estimates derived from a range of publicly available datasets. These
  estimates do not necessarily represent or align with official datasets
  collected by national governments.

- **Relative Index Comparison:** All indices within this database,
  including the CCRI, are designed for relative comparison among the
  countries included in the model. This means that a country\'s
  performance on any given index is assessed as comparatively better or
  worse in relation to all other countries within the model, rather than
  against an absolute benchmark.
