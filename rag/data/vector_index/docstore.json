For subnational assessments such\n  as CCRI-DRM, the database could support hazard exposure data if\n  country level data is unavailable.\n\n- **Emergency Preparedness and Response:** By providing insights into\n  potential hazard impacts and historical occurrences, the database is\n  crucial for developing robust emergency preparedness plans, informing\n  anticipatory action, and guiding immediate disaster response and\n  recovery efforts.\n\n- **Climate Financing:** The data can be leveraged to advocate for\n  climate financing towards regions and communities most vulnerable to\n  hazards, ensuring resources are allocated effectively to build\n  resilience and implement adaptation strategies.\n\n- **Programming and Targeting:** The database support the design and\n  implementation of child-focused programs by identifying high-risk\n  areas and populations, allowing for precise targeting of interventions\n  to reduce children\\'s vulnerability including providing estimates for\n  the next UNICEF Strategic Plan. It can also be used for sub-national\n  equity analysis and Climate Landscape Analysis.\n\n- **Influencing International and National Policy:** By providing\n  concrete, evidence-based data on child exposure to hazards, the\n  database is an invaluable tool for advocating for and shaping policies\n  at both national and international levels, driving legislative and\n  strategic changes to protect children from various hazards.\n\n- **Research and Academic Study:** The standardized and comprehensive\n  nature of the database makes it a valuable resource for academic\n  research, fostering a deeper understanding of the complex interactions\n  between hazards, climate change, and child welfare.\n\n- **Disaster Risk Reduction Strategies:** Understanding the spatial and\n  temporal characteristics of hazards allows for the development and\n  implementation of targeted disaster risk reduction strategies,\n  focusing on prevention, mitigation, and adaptation measures.\n\nThis technical documentation serves as a live document, with new hazard\nlayers and updates to be incorporated as data becomes available,\nensuring the database remains a cutting-edge and adaptable tool in\nproviding evidence.\n\nWhile the first version of the database only includes climate hazards,\nother relevant hazards (geophysical, conflict) will be added in 2025 Q3\nand potentially expanding to include environmental indicators in 2025 Q4\nand beyond (as data becomes available).\n\n# Introduction\n\nUNICEF plays a crucial role in protecting and promoting the rights of\nchildren worldwide. As children around the world are increasingly\nexposed to multiple hazards, access to reliable and comprehensive hazard\ndata is essential for effective programming and advocacy. This handbook\naims to provide an overview of the various types of hazard data\navailable, as well as guidance on how to access, analyze, understand,\nvisualize and utilize this data.\n\nThe primary audience for this handbook is all relevant UNICEF staff and\npartners. This is intended to be a live document and new hazard layers\nwill be added/updated as data becomes available in the future.\n\n**Why do we need a standardized Global Child Hazard Database?**\n\nStandardization is needed to ensure a shared understanding of these\ndiverse datasets with comparability and consistency and includes the\nfollowing key areas.\n\n![](./media/image1.png){width=\"6.0942858705161855in\"\nheight=\"3.2152777777777777in\"}\n\n# Understanding Hazard Data \n\nA hazard can be defined as any process, phenomenon or human activity\nthat may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property\ndamage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation.\n\n**Hazard Categories**\n\nClassification of hazards varies across different institutions and for\nthe Global Child Hazard Database, UNDRR's terminology and classification\nschemes have been applied and are categorized into the following general\ncategories:\n\n- **Hydrometeorological hazards**\u00a0are of atmospheric, hydrological or\n  oceanographic origin. Examples are tropical cyclones (also known as\n  typhoons and hurricanes); floods, including flash floods; drought;\n  heatwaves and cold spells; and coastal storm surges.\n  Hydrometeorological conditions may also be a factor in other hazards\n  such as landslides, wildland fires, locust plagues, epidemics and in\n  the transport and dispersal of toxic substances and volcanic eruption\n  material (UNDRR, 2020).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3695, "end_char_idx": 8741, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbc09820-dfc0-4ea7-831e-c3d6aad82a81": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbc09820-dfc0-4ea7-831e-c3d6aad82a81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "062db09e-9e61-43ce-801d-fa2ec58e80de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2fdec0eb8448317e7ecbdf085378d5e717f3209b21c5fbbab312e899dbaa965d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e281699-2dc2-4c9f-b19c-85426b41854f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4a42b18c6dfe16d491f8af65dc1888d6293e459ccaae6ba1d04cb6cc37120f19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "**Hazard Categories**\n\nClassification of hazards varies across different institutions and for\nthe Global Child Hazard Database, UNDRR's terminology and classification\nschemes have been applied and are categorized into the following general\ncategories:\n\n- **Hydrometeorological hazards**\u00a0are of atmospheric, hydrological or\n  oceanographic origin.

Climate\n  data is used to better understand long term climate patterns, trends,\n  and future conditions. This could be both observed and/or modelled\n  data and includes both historical data and future projections (more\n  details under section 1.3).\n\n- **Climate hazard** refers to natural events that are pre-dominantly\n  hydro-meteorological in nature such as floods, tropical storms,\n  heatwaves, wildfires and droughts. These hazards can be exacerbated by\n  climate change, leading to increased frequency, intensity, and\n  unpredictability. Understanding climate hazards is core to risk\n  analysis, emergency preparedness and planning for effective mitigation\n  and adaptation.\n\n- **Climate change** refers to the change in climate over an extended\n  period caused by natural processes such as volcanic eruptions or\n  variations in solar radiation as well as human activities such as over\n  burning fossil fuels, deforestation and over emission of greenhouse\n  gases. There is adequate evidence that anthropogenic climate change is\n  increasing the frequency and intensity of climate hazards as well as\n  influence along with existing natural variability that causes climate\n  hazards. In other words, not all climate hazards are results of\n  human-induced climate change. Attribution to climate change is a\n  complex process and at the time of this writing, there is still\n  limited data available to differentiate the two.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- **Climate sensitive** hazards could be used to refer to air pollution\n  and diseases (vector borne such as malaria, dengue, zika and\n  water-borne such as cholera) which could be intensified because of\n  climate crisis\n\n- **Environmental Hazards** may include chemical, natural and biological\n  hazards. They can be created by environmental degradation or physical\n  or chemical pollution in the air, water and soil. However, many of the\n  processes and phenomena that fall into this category may be termed\n  drivers of hazard and risk rather than hazards in themselves, such as\n  soil degradation, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, salinization\n  and sea-level rise (UNDRR, 2020).\n\n- **Geophysical hazards**\u00a0originate from internal earth processes.\n  Examples are earthquakes, volcanic activity and emissions, and related\n  geophysical processes such as mass movements, landslides, rockslides,\n  surface collapses and debris or mud flows. Hydrometeorological factors\n  are important contributors to some of these processes. Tsunamis are\n  difficult to categorize although they are triggered by undersea\n  earthquakes and other geological events, they essentially become an\n  oceanic process that is manifested as a coastal water-related hazard\n  (UNDRR, 2020).\n\n*All the above are interconnected and contribute to improving our\nunderstanding of the triple planetary crisis. Each hazard often triggers\na sub-set of hazards, for instance tropical cyclones (known as\nhurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, cyclones in the Indian Ocean and\ntyphoons in the Northern Pacific Ocean) can bring intense winds, storm\nsurge and heavy rainfall, as well as trigger secondary hazards, for\ninstance landslides. A series of triggering relationships can cause a\ndomino or cascading effect (UNDRR, 2020).*\n\n**Hazard Characteristics**\n\nHazards occur at different magnitudes (intensity) over different time\nscales (duration) and can occur multiple times (frequency). In general,\nintensities can be expressed in terms of absolute measures such as km/hr\nfor cyclone windspeed or m depth for flood. Return periods are used to\ncombine both measures. In general, the longer the return period (the\nless frequent the hazard) the greater the intensity of the hazard\n(UNDRR, 2020).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7985, "end_char_idx": 12697, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e281699-2dc2-4c9f-b19c-85426b41854f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e281699-2dc2-4c9f-b19c-85426b41854f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fbc09820-dfc0-4ea7-831e-c3d6aad82a81", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f9c883575c136cbb41124fae564b17fdcd25b0633057a91b3a780b4ee1f686f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3f3a0c85-0d18-4f18-8da0-58420d7ecdc2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "69c4f672e237b6c0e5046d5b5d9613983f12bcf358691cd10966f12b5ef8be61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A series of triggering relationships can cause a\ndomino or cascading effect (UNDRR, 2020).*\n\n**Hazard Characteristics**\n\nHazards occur at different magnitudes (intensity) over different time\nscales (duration) and can occur multiple times (frequency).

In general, the longer the return period (the\nless frequent the hazard) the greater the intensity of the hazard\n(UNDRR, 2020). Interaction between multiple hazards could result in an\noverall impact that is greater than a single hazard happening at\ndifferent times.\n\n**Know your hazard data type!**\n\nOnce hazards are identified, the next step is to collect a range of\nhazard-related data that shows spatial and temporal characteristics.\nThere are five different phases of hazard data to be considered\ndepending on the use cases. While some can be substituted for others,\nnot all can be used inter-changeably. The process can be challenging due\nto data limitations and in determining how best to consider secondary\nhazards that can be triggered by a primary event.\n\n1.  **Probabilistic/Modelled Data**\n\nProbabilistic hazard models are generated through computer simulations\nusing complex mathematical models and rely on statistical analysis of\npast data. These models help the users to understand areas that could\npotentially be impacted by a specific hazard and are usually available\nin different Return Periods. A Return Period represents the average\ninterval of time between occurrences of the event. It is important to\nnote that this does not mean the event will happen exactly once every\n100 years. Instead, it indicates a\u00a01% probability\u00a0of the event occurring\nin any given year. Similarly, a 10-year return period event has a\u00a010%\nprobability\u00a0of occurring in any given year.\n\nA 100-year return period has been chosen as the default as it has a high\nchance of an event of a considerable magnitude happening within a\nlifetime. For example, a\u00a0100-year flood\u00a0is a flood that has a\u00a01%\nprobability\u00a0of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. There is\napproximately a\u00a063.4% chance\u00a0of experiencing at least one 100-year flood\nwithin a 100-year period.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Return Period (years)   Probability of experiencing at least one event\n                                       in a 100-year period\n  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------\n            2                                  100%\n\n            5                                  100%\n\n            20                                99.41%\n\n            50                                86.74%\n\n           100                                63.40%\n\n           500                                18.14%\n\n           1000                               9.52%\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUsed in risk assessments, preparedness, and planning.\n\n2.  **Historical Observations**\n\nHistorical observations provide a baseline for understanding the\nfrequency, intensity, and spatial distribution of hazards. This data is\nusually collected over a significant period to document past\noccurrences, helping users to understand the spatial and temporal\ndistribution of each hazard. For example, 20 years of observed flood\ndata from the Ganges plains could help us understand the possible areas\nat risk for floods. It is to note that global historical observation\ndatabases for many hazards are largely incomplete and often not updated\nregularly with spatial extent.\n\nUsed in risk assessments, preparedness, and planning.\n\n3.  **Forecast**\n\nForecasts offer short-term predictions of specific climate hazard\nevents, enabling early warning systems and helping communities prepare\nfor potential impacts. Hurricane forecasts, wildfire risk assessments,\nand flood warnings are examples of climate forecasts.\n\nUsed in anticipatory action and early warning.\n\n4.  **Impact**\n\nImpact data assesses the consequences of climate hazards on people,\nproperty, and the environment. Understanding impacts helps to assess\nvulnerability and develop effective mitigation and adaptation\nstrategies. Economic losses, loss of life, damage to infrastructure, and\necosystem disruption are some of the potential impacts of climate\nhazards. For example, satellite-based flood observations are used for\nflood response immediately after an event.\n\nUsed in disaster response and recovery -- also added to the historical\nobservations.\n\n5.  **Projected Data**\n\nProjected data are future predictions of climate hazards based on\nclimate models and historical observations. Projections of sea-level\nrise, extreme precipitation events, and heatwave frequency are examples\nof projected data that help us anticipate future risks.

As a rule\nof thumb, if an event significantly deviates from the norm in terms of\ntheir intensity, duration and impact, it could be considered as extreme\nevents and for each hazard, thresholds are determined using expert\ninput.\n\n**What is climate attribution?**\n\nAttribution in climate science determines the human influence on\nspecific weather events. It answers: \\\"Did human-caused climate change\nmake this event more likely or intense?\\\" This involves comparing the\nevent\\'s probability and intensity in the current climate versus a\nhypothetical one without human greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n# Data Acquisition and Cataloging\n\nMultiple data sources were considered for each hazard and were carefully\nevaluated. The final selection is identified based on the following\npre-established criteria: All input data must be open, globally\navailable for all countries, quantifiable and comparable but most\nimportantly spatially distributed. The diagram below shows the six\ncriteria used in data selection.\n\n![](./media/image2.png){width=\"5.170476815398075in\"\nheight=\"2.087179571303587in\"}\n\nProxy indicators are considered where global open data is not available.\nQuality dimension of basic data is considered to maximize the overall\nquality of the final CCRI, and within the constraints of data\navailability and include their relevance, accuracy, timeliness,\naccessibility, interpretability and coherence (OECD, 2008).\n\n# Hazard Data Processing\n\nThe functionality of this database is contingent upon precise hazard\ndata processing.

Individual country population data is first downloaded and\nmosaicked into a single, global composite layer for further processing.\nWorldpop is chosen for its higher resolution, global availability and as\nit has the least bias in estimating rural population (Ritter, 2025).\n\nLimitations:\n\nWorldPop is a modeled product that disaggregates coarser census or\nprojected data onto finer grids using various geospatial covariates;\nthus, the accuracy of its output is intrinsically linked to the age and\nreliability of its input data. While some WorldPop datasets are adjusted\nto align with UN WPP national totals, the underlying spatial\ndistribution might still differ from official national census figures or\nthe detailed demographic structures assumed by the UN\\'s own\nprojections, as WorldPop\\'s modeling cannot fully replicate the granular\ninformation gathered through comprehensive national censuses.\n\n**Hazard data:**\n\n## Flood \n\nFloods are the natural hazard with the highest frequency and widest\ngeographic distribution (UNISDR, 2017) and are described in terms of\nfrequency and intensity (water extent and depth). There are three common\ntypes of flooding.\n\n- Fluvial (riverine)\n\n- Coastal (storm surge / sea level rise)\n\n- Pluvial (surface water / flash floods)\n\nRelevance:\n\nFloods are a critical concern in climate change discussions due to their\nwidespread impact on human and natural systems. According to the IPCC\n2022 AR 6 report, food risks and societal damages are projected to\nincrease with every increment of global warming (medium confidence)\n(IPCC, 2022). They exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, particularly in\ncommunities already facing socioeconomic challenges. Children are\nespecially vulnerable to the impacts of floods. Floods can disrupt their\naccess to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare, leading to increased\nrisks of diseases. Additionally, floods can cause significant\npsychological stress and trauma, affecting children\\'s mental health and\ndevelopment (IPCC, 2022).\n\n**Fluvial Flood**\n\nA fluvial or riverine flood is a rise, usually brief, in the water level\nof a stream or water body to a peak from which the water level recedes\nat a slower rate (WMO, 2012). The primary cause of a fluvial flood is an\nextended precipitation event that occurs at, or upstream from, the\naffected area and can also occur when traditional flood-control\nstructures, such as levees and dikes, are overtopped.\n\nData source:\n\nFluvial flood has been extensively studied, and multiple global models\nare freely available at different return periods. JRC's gridded Global\nFlood Hazard model (Baugh, 2024) at 100-year return period and 90m\nspatial resolution has been chosen and water depth above 1cm (defined as\ndata pixel value greater than or equal to in our processing pipeline)\nhas been considered for exposure analysis.\n\nData processing:\n\nChildren's exposure to riverine flood hazard was calculated by simple\noverlay of the flood hazard and the high-resolution gridded global child\npopulation layer. The results were then summarized to different\nadministrative boundaries as absolute and relative values for all the\nMember States and territories using zonal statistics.\n\nCoverage: Global\n\nIndicators:\n\n- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,\n  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to riverine floods\n\n- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,\n  women, men), normalized scores of exposures riverine floods\n\nData limitations: While major riverine floods have been modelled at\nhigher resolution, data might not cover smaller rivers.\n\n**Coastal Flood**\n\nCoastal flooding is most frequently the result of storm surges and high\nwinds coinciding with high tides (WMO, 2011).\n\nData source:\n\nA few open, global coastal flood models were compared at different\nreturn periods.

It is typically a slow\u202fon-set phenomenon\ncaused by a lack of rainfall and can occur in four stages that are\nusually categorized as four drought types.\n\n- Meteorological drought\n\n- Agricultural drought\n\n- Hydrological drought\n\n- Socio-economic drought\n\nRelevance:\n\nDrought has always been a part of the natural variability of Earth's\nclimate.\u202fClimate change increasingly puts pressure on food production\nand access, especially in vulnerable regions, and undermines food\nsecurity and nutrition (WMO, 2012) The increase in the frequency,\nintensity, and duration of droughts will increase risks to food security\n(IPCC, 2022). Children are especially impacted by various drought risks.\nThe lack of water can compromise their access to clean drinking water\nand sanitation, increasing the risk of diseases. Additionally, droughts\ncan lead to food shortages, impacting children\\'s nutrition and overall\nhealth. The psychological stress and trauma associated with drought\nconditions can also affect children\\'s mental health and development\n(IPCC, 2022).\n\n**Agricultural Drought**\n\nAgricultural drought occurs when there is insufficient soil moisture to\nmeet the needs of a particular crop at a particular time (FAO, 2025).\n\nData source:\n\nThe Agricultural Stress Index (ASI) facilitates the early identification\nof cropped land with a high likelihood of water stress (drought).\u00a0The\nIndex is based on the integration of the Vegetation Health Index (VHI)\nin two dimensions that are critical in the assessment of a drought event\nin agriculture: temporal and spatial. The first step is a temporal\naveraging of the VHI, assessing the intensity and duration of dry\nperiods occurring during the crop cycle at the pixel level. The second\nstep determines the spatial extent of drought events by calculating the\npercentage of pixels in arable areas with a VHI value below 35 percent\n(this value was identified as a critical threshold in assessing the\nextent of drought in previous research by Kogan, 1995). Each\nadministrative area is classified according to the percentage of the\naffected area to facilitate the quick interpretation of results (FAO,\n2025). A 100-year return period was generated using the long-term\naverage from 1984 - 2023 as a proxy as it depicts the percentage of\narable land, within an administrative area, that has been affected by\ndrought conditions over the entire cropping season.\n\nData processing:\n\nChildren's exposure to agricultural drought was calculated by simple\noverlay of the areas where the 100-year ASI return period with over 30%\ncropland is affected and the high-resolution gridded global child\npopulation layer. The results were then summarized to different\nadministrative boundaries as absolute and relative values for all the\nMember States and territories using zonal statistics.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 24748, "end_char_idx": 29525, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a5619f5-061b-4bff-bcc4-3323e902943b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a5619f5-061b-4bff-bcc4-3323e902943b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6abed534-86e7-4e57-907d-845b08eab125", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff1d5f8a5da34e34abf22ea4dbe33d49c94d811514396e0404e7bd40ec6e3ff7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29231f1a-8ee5-4b4d-9259-a39679148f36", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2503645e939cb7d506d706a7c831c2229c88fd4b49e644ba4cda421efcfad92f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Each\nadministrative area is classified according to the percentage of the\naffected area to facilitate the quick interpretation of results (FAO,\n2025).

For the lack of better model, the\ndrought exposure estimates in the database assumes children living in\nareas close to the actual location of agricultural drought to be\ndirectly affected and does not consider children living in areas that\ndepend on the crop production as their primary food source which is hard\nto model globally.\n\n**Meteorological Drought**\n\nDefinition:\\\nMeteorological drought occurs when dry weather patterns dominate an\narea, defined by the degree of dryness and the duration of the dry\nperiod (WMO, 2021).\n\nData Source:\n\nThe Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized\nPrecipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) were sourced from the\nEuropean Copernicus Global Drought Observatory, available at \\~25 km\nspatial resolution.\n\n- SPI measures the deviation of precipitation from the climatological\n  average over a given accumulation period and is widely used to detect\n  and characterize meteorological droughts.\n\n- SPEI adds the effect of evapotranspiration and is better suited to\n  assess droughts under climate change scenarios where temperature\n  changes are important.\\\n  Longer accumulation periods (e.g., 12 months) are associated with\n  persistent droughts and may also reflect agricultural and hydrological\n  drought conditions (Copernicus, 2025).\n\n> Data Processing:\n\n- Monthly aggregated SPI and SPEI data using a 12-month accumulation\n  period were used for the years 2014--2024.\n\n- Areas experiencing meteorological drought were identified as those\n  with SPI or SPEI \\< -1, corresponding to approximately the driest 10%\n  of conditions.\n\n- These areas were overlaid with a high-resolution gridded global child\n  population dataset to estimate exposure.\n\n- Zonal statistics were used to summarize both absolute counts and\n  relative proportions of exposed populations (children and total\n  population, disaggregated by sex) across multiple administrative\n  boundaries.\n\nCoverage: Global\n\nIndicators:\n\n- Absolute exposure of children to Meteorological hazards (counts):\n\n  - Children (total, girls, boys)People (total, women, men)\n\n  - Normalized exposure scores (SPI and SPEI)\n\n- Relative exposure of children to Meteorological hazards (percent of\n  population):\n\n  - Children (total, girls, boys)\n\n  - People (total, women, men)\n\n  - Normalized exposure scores (SPI and SPEI)\n\nData Limitations:\n\n- The drought datasets have coarser spatial resolution (\\~25 km)\n  compared to some other hazard data layers such as ASI (Agricultural\n  Stress Index).\n\n- Return period analysis (e.g., Gumbel fitting for extreme dryness) was\n  not satisfactory due to:\n\n  - The sparse frequency of extreme dry events in the observation period\n\n  - The distribution of SPI and SPEI values across both negative and\n    positive ranges, complicating traditional extreme value fitting.\n\n## Tropical Storms\n\nA tropical storm is a type of storm system characterized by a\nlow-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong\nwinds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain\n(WMO, 2021).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 28712, "end_char_idx": 33232, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29231f1a-8ee5-4b4d-9259-a39679148f36": {"__data__": {"id_": "29231f1a-8ee5-4b4d-9259-a39679148f36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a5619f5-061b-4bff-bcc4-3323e902943b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d03410bd4f3b4e0b4f19b8a0f15544e06bb49267fd46b2c76ad569540060b92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7ae7936-2772-4d12-af23-ad8bf827f338", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd045009800bbdb2497d6d4277b942dff44692beedf5a196998301c4e1ba4f77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "- Return period analysis (e.g., Gumbel fitting for extreme dryness) was\n  not satisfactory due to:\n\n  - The sparse frequency of extreme dry events in the observation period\n\n  - The distribution of SPI and SPEI values across both negative and\n    positive ranges, complicating traditional extreme value fitting.\n\n## Tropical Storms\n\nA tropical storm is a type of storm system characterized by a\nlow-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong\nwinds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain\n(WMO, 2021). Tropical storm classification is adopted from WMO's\nguidance where wind speed greater than 63 km/hr is considered as a named\ntropical storm (WMO, 2023)\n\nRelevance:\n\nTropical storms can cause significant damage through high winds, heavy\nrainfall, and storm surges, leading to flooding, property destruction,\nand loss of life. Climate change is increasing the intensity and\nfrequency of tropical storms. Warmer sea surface temperatures and higher\natmospheric moisture levels contribute to more powerful storms with\ngreater precipitation. This intensification is linked to human-induced\ngreenhouse gas emissions, which have led to observable changes in storm\npatterns and behaviors (IPCC, 2022). Children are particularly\nvulnerable to the effects of tropical storms. These events can disrupt\ntheir access to clean water, food, and healthcare, increasing the risk\nof malnutrition and diseases and can lead to psychological trauma.\n\nData source:\n\nThe tropical cyclone wind data is derived from UNEP GIRI and indicates\nthe mean value of wind velocity for a return period of 100 years. The\nmap has global coverage and a resolution of 6\\' (\\~11.1 kilometers at\nthe equator) (CDRI, 2023). The tracks of historical tropical cyclones\nused in GIRI were obtained from the IBTrACS database and hazard analysis\nwas divided by oceanic basis with different cut off years, based on data\navailability (GIRI, 2023)\n\nData processing:\n\nChildren's exposure to tropical storms was calculated by simple overlay\nof the areas where the wind speed is over 63 km/hr and the\nhigh-resolution gridded global child population layer. The results were\nthen summarized to different administrative boundaries as absolute and\nrelative values for all the Member States and territories using zonal\nstatistics.\n\nCoverage: Global\n\nIndicators:\n\n- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,\n  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to tropical storms\n\n- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,\n  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to tropical storms\n\nData limitations:\n\nThe accuracy of the probabilistic hazard model depends on the\ncompleteness of historical tropical cyclone data which varies from one\nocean to another. Incomplete data can lead to underestimation or\noverestimation of storm exposure.\n\n## Heatwave and Extreme Heat\n\nA heatwave can be defined as a period where local excess heat\naccumulates over a sequence of unusually hot days and nights (WMO,\n2022). Heatwaves are complex phenomena and at present, there is no\nuniversal consensus on a global metric. The specific criteria for what\nconstitute a heatwave can vary by region, but it generally involves\ntemperatures significantly higher than the average for that area and\ntime of year.\n\nA heatwave is defined as any period of 3 days or more when the maximum\ntemperature each day is in the top 10% of the local 15-day average and\nthe following three dimensions were considered:\n\n- Heatwave frequency\u00a0refers to the number of heatwaves per year.\n\n- Heatwave duration\u00a0refers to the total number of days an event lasts.\n\n- Heatwave severity\u00a0refers to the temperature above the local 15-day\n  average during the heatwave, expressed in degrees Celsius.\n\nExtremely high temperatures\u00a0(extremely hot days) are estimated when a\nday exceeds 35 degrees Celsius.\n\nRelevance:\n\nTemperature is one of the core indicators to describe climate and there\nis clear evidence that climate change is increasing global temperatures\nand causing historic heat waves all around the world, with higher\nfrequencies, duration and severity (IPCC, 2022).

For instance, with the above\ndefinition, heatwave severity increasing in the Nordic countries could\nlead to ecological impact which in turn could affect children's ability\nto have a quality life. It could lead to increased probability of\nwildfires which could decrease the air quality.\n\nHeat stress represents a significant and growing hazard, particularly\nfor vulnerable populations such as children, due to its direct\nphysiological impact and exacerbation of existing health conditions. ^1^\nWhile the availability of global data on heat stress exposure is\nsteadily increasing, facilitating broader analysis, a universally\naccepted global threshold for children\\'s safe exposure levels currently\nremains undefined, highlighting a critical area for further research and\npolicy development.\n\nData source:\n\nTemperature input\u00a0is calculated using daily aggregate temperature data\nfrom the ERA5 reanalysis (Mu\u00f1oz, 2019). ERA5, produced by the Copernicus\nClimate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF, is the fifth-generation\natmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from\nJanuary 1940 to present (ECMWF, 2025). A 100-year return period was\ngenerated from the 1960-2024 ERA5 LAND data.\n\nTo assess the extremity of climate-related heatwave\nindicators---including annual frequency, duration, severity, and the\nnumber of days exceeding 35\u00b0C---we estimated multi-year return levels\nusing a non-parametric, empirical approach. For each pixel, annual\nvalues were sorted in descending order, and empirical return periods\nwere assigned using Weibull plotting positions, i.e., \ud835\udc47=(\ud835\udc5b+1)/rank,\nwhere \ud835\udc5b is the number of years. Return levels for specific periods\n(e.g., 10-, 30-, 50-, and 100-year events) were then derived by\ninterpolating the observed annual extremes against their associated\nempirical return periods. This method avoids distributional assumptions\n(e.g., Gumbel or GEV) and is particularly suited for short observational\nrecords or count-based variables such as event frequency. The approach\naligns with recommended practices in climate extremes analysis,\nespecially when parametric assumptions may not be valid or robust (WMO,\n2009; Wilks, 2011; Coles, 2001).\n\nFor land areas, we used the ERA5-Land dataset, which offers a spatial\nresolution of approximately 10 km. However, since the ERA5-Land product\nexcludes Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and many island regions\ndue to its land-sea masking, we used the standard ERA5 dataset at a\ncoarser resolution of approximately 24 km for those areas. Data for SIDS\nwas obtained for the same time period as the land areas and processed\nusing the same methodology to ensure consistency across the analysis.\n\nData processing:\n\nChildren's exposure to individual dimensions was calculated by simple\noverlay of the areas where the individual dimension of heatwave is\ngreater than the long-term average and the high-resolution gridded\nglobal children population layer.

A significant challenge lies in the lack of a\nuniversal definition for \\\"heatwave\\\" or \\\"extreme heat,\\\" leading to\ninconsistencies across different data sources and complicating\ncross-regional comparisons. The exclusion of humidity metrics can lead\nto an underestimation of actual physiological heat stress. Observational\ndata sparsity, especially in remote or less developed regions,\nintroduces uncertainties, and current datasets often do not adequately\ncapture the localized amplification of temperatures due to the Urban\nHeat Island effect. Finally, a critical gap remains in the absence of a\nglobally accepted physiological threshold for children\\'s safe exposure\nto heat, hindering precise impact assessments for this highly vulnerable\ndemographic.\n\n## \n\n## Sand and Dust Storms \n\nSand and dust storms (SDS) are caused by intense winds over areas of\narid soil that pick up large amounts of ground material into the\natmosphere. The most significant dust sources globally are concentrated\nin arid and semi-arid regions, particularly major deserts such as the\nSahara in Africa, the Gobi in Asia, and the Arabian Desert in the Middle\nEast. They originate from natural sources like deserts, dry lake beds,\nand coastal regions with loose sediment. Human activities exacerbate the\nproblem through construction, agriculture, and poor land management\npractices that strip vegetation and expose soil to wind erosion. Climate\nchange amplifies the occurrence of sand and dust storms by altering\nweather patterns and reducing vegetation cover. (WMO, 2021).\n\nRelevance:\n\nOver the past few decades, land degradation has contributed\nsignificantly to the increased number and size of anthropogenic SDS\nsources. Current trends in deforestation, agricultural expansion, and\nmore frequent and severe droughts and heatwaves make countries more\nsusceptible to SDS hazards (UNCCD 2021). Exposure to dust can lead to\nrespiratory problems, allergies, and other health issues and the\ndisruption of daily activities and schooling due to poor air quality can\nalso affect children\\'s education and overall wellbeing.\n\nData source:\n\nUNCCD's Sand and Dust Storm susceptibility layer at 1km resolution is\nused. It employs global datasets for four indicators to estimate the\nextent of source potential and derive source intensity values: (i) soil\ntexture (proportion of sand, silt, and clay), (ii) soil moisture\n(absolute minimum value), (iii) soil temperature (absolute maximum\nvalue), and (iv) land cover (bare land fraction).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 39585, "end_char_idx": 44312, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d038b465-275f-4729-8b6a-fa4b0fca60e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d038b465-275f-4729-8b6a-fa4b0fca60e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0139f4e-c3ef-4b2c-8687-3b53c1356e49", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6f8589c63ede1d10bcb4dcd2603ec84782e54c21ce735c3697095973085209de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "df0d4b52-4f1b-4bfb-8686-6eb2f8ad9707", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8f8fd7afdd4463cf214f9d1f1b95ffd89af0f0517a75d51e82f7f20edb70fcd6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Current trends in deforestation, agricultural expansion, and\nmore frequent and severe droughts and heatwaves make countries more\nsusceptible to SDS hazards (UNCCD 2021).

This could underestimate the\noverall global exposure. The adopted methods in SDS base map also have\nlimited precision in identifying lower intensity sources due to the lack\nof data as well as the high degree of uncertainty associated with\nsoil-related data (UNCCD, 2024).\n\n## Fires\n\nWildfires are uncontrolled burns of vegetation, including forests,\nshrublands, grasslands, savannas, and croplands. They can be caused by\nhuman activity or natural causes (UNDRR, 2020). Fires caused\ndeliberately for land clearance (agriculture and ranching) or\naccidentally (lightning strikes and human error) are a major factor in\nland-cover variability and change and hence affect fluxes of energy and\nwater to the atmosphere (WMO, 2025).\n\nRelevance:\n\nFires can lead to significant loss of biodiversity, destruction of\nproperty, and air pollution but they can also contribute to climate\nchange by releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse\ngases into the atmosphere (IPCC, 2022). \u00a0Climate change is increasing\nthe frequency and intensity of fires. Higher temperatures, prolonged\ndroughts, and changes in vegetation patterns create conditions that are\nmore conducive to wildfires, and human activities such as land use\nchanges and deforestation also exacerbate the risk of fires (IPCC,\n2022). Children are particularly vulnerable as they are exposed to smoke\nand air pollutants from fires that can lead to respiratory problems,\nallergies, and other health issues. Fires also impact their overall\nwell-being, education and could cause significant psychological trauma.\n\nData source:\n\nTwo indicators are used to better understand fires -- Frequency and\nIntensity.\n\nFire frequency is obtained from NASA's Fire Information for Resource\nManagement System (FIRMS) is used as a proxy for fire hazard. Average\nfire frequency from 2001-2023 has been considered. The MODIS Fire and\nThermal Anomalies product is available from the Terra (MOD14) and Aqua\n(MYD14) satellites as well as a combined Terra and Aqua (MCD14). The\nMODIS Fire and Thermal Anomalies products are derived from the MODIS\nsensors onboard the Terra (MOD14) and Aqua (MYD14) satellites.

These substances\ncan include particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon\nmonoxide, and ozone (WHO, 2021).\n\nRelevance:\n\nClimate change and air pollution are closely linked. Many activities\nthat produce greenhouse gases also emit air pollutants, which can act as\nshort-lived climate forcers and can warm or cool the Earth\\'s climate\nover shorter time scales (IPCC, 2022). Air pollution threatens\nchildren\\'s health and is the biggest environmental health risk factor\n(UNICEF, 2024). Exposure to pollutants can lead to respiratory problems,\nasthma, and other health issues. Poor air quality can also affect\nchildren\\'s development and cognitive function. Air pollution was the\nsecond leading risk factor for death among children under five in 2021,\nafter malnutrition.\n\n**Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5):**\n\nFine particle air pollution, or PM2 .5, refers to airborne particles\nmeasuring less than 2 .5 micrometers in diameter that could be emitted\nfrom vehicles, residential fuel use, coal-burning power plants,\nagricultural and industrial activities, waste burning, wildfires, and\nmany other human and natural sources. Among the key air pollutants that\nare currently measured, long-term exposure to PM2.5 is the most\nconsistent and accurate predictor of poor health outcomes across\npopulations.

ACAG data is currently unavailable in\nhigher latitudes, so not fully global at the moment and could be an\nunderrepresentation for some countries.\n\n## Vector borne diseases \n\nVector borne disease are human illnesses caused by parasites, viruses,\nand bacteria that are transmitted by vectors.\n\nRelevance:\n\nClimate change can alter the distribution and abundance of vectors,\nleading to changes in the incidence and geographic range of these\ndiseases. Higher temperatures combined with land use/land cover change\nare making more areas suitable for the transmission of vector-borne\ndiseases (IPCC, 2022). Children are particularly susceptible to severe\nhealth problems from vector-borne diseases. For instance, malaria can\ncause high fever, anemia, and neurological complications, which are\nespecially dangerous for young children and can also lead to increased\nmortality (WHO, 2024). Illnesses can also lead to malnutrition, disrupt\neducation and affect a child's overall well-being.\n\nNote: While there is various vector borne diseases such as dengue, zika\nand others, due to lack of global data availability, only Malaria was\nconsidered for the global child hazard database.\n\n**Malaria**\n\nMalaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to\nhumans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes (WHO,\n2021). There are 5\u00a0*Plasmodium*\u00a0parasite species that cause malaria in\nhumans and 2 of these species --\u00a0*P. falciparum*\u00a0and\u00a0*P. vivax*\u00a0-- pose\nthe greatest threat.\u00a0*P. falciparum*\u00a0is the deadliest malaria parasite\nand the most prevalent on the African continent.\u00a0*P. vivax*\u00a0is the\ndominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan\nAfrica (WHO, 2021).\u00a0\n\nData source:\n\nGridded long-term estimates were downloaded from Malaria Atlas Project\n(MAP, 2025) and estimated from the global malariometric data (Pfeffer et\nal, 2018)\n\n- Gridded average number of newly diagnosed\u00a0*Plasmodium\n  falciparum*\u00a0cases per 1,000 population from 2012-2022 is used as a\n  proxy for the spread of Malaria by Plasmodium falciparum\n\n- Gridded average number of newly diagnosed\u00a0*Plasmodium vivax*\u00a0cases per\n  1,000 population from 2012-2022 is used as a proxy for the spread of\n  Malaria by Plasmodium vivax\n\nData processing:\n\nAll children living in areas with more than 1 case is estimated as\nchildren exposed to Malaria (individually calculated for each) and\noverlaid with high-resolution gridded global children population layer.\nThe results were then summarized to different administrative boundaries\nas absolute and relative values for all the Member States and\nterritories using zonal statistics.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 51084, "end_char_idx": 55098, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b3bebde-8255-49be-aac5-fa4e1c0e0b56": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b3bebde-8255-49be-aac5-fa4e1c0e0b56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb5b3c06-a7aa-4683-863e-166a6a7ece1a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e7d4e97c7804a1e6708940994d84698fca70c3193fde9e20fb58f6a96b3965a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a62f4d2e-2fa2-4e65-b869-420171b0c450", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "12506a4ea13d033085725fc30bdef94b2847eae19e8cc63d847e198fc4f2e0d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The results were then summarized to different administrative boundaries\nas absolute and relative values for all the Member States and\nterritories using zonal statistics.\n\nCoverage: Global\n\nIndicator:\n\n- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,\n  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to Malaria (Plasmodium\n  Falciparum)\n\n- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,\n  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to Malaria (Plasmodium\n  Falciparum)\n\n- Absolute number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,\n  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to Malaria (Plasmodium\n  Vivax)\n\n- Relative number of children (total, girls, boys), people (total,\n  women, men), normalized scores of exposures to Malaria (Plasmodium\n  Vivax)\n\nData limitations:\n\nDue to limitations in data availability, Malaria indicators only include\nestimates based on reported cases and does not include areas susceptible\nto Malaria based on climate indicators.

This approach allows for a more\nprecise understanding of climate risks at both local and national\nlevels, with the flexibility to aggregate data to administrative levels\n0, 1, or 2 based on the specific use case.\n\n**Multi-hazard count**\n\n**Definition and Purpose**\n\nThe Multi-hazard Count indicator quantifies the number of distinct\nclimate and climate-sensitive hazards that are likely to occur in the\nsame location and overlap with child populations. It is computed at high\nspatial resolution (up to 100 meters), allowing for fine-grained\nanalysis of compounded climate risks.\n\nEach hazard is processed with applied thresholds to identify areas where\nits intensity exceeds a meaningful level of risk. These binary hazard\nmasks are then stacked to calculate, per pixel, the number of different\nhazards present. This results in a hazard count map, where pixel values\nreflect the number of hazards a given location is exposed to.\n\nTo make the indicator child-focused, this multi-hazard count layer is\nspatially filtered using high-resolution child population data. The\nresult is a map that highlights only the areas where children are\npresent and exposed to one or more hazards. While the pixel values\nindicate the number of overlapping hazards, they only appear in\nlocations with non-zero child population.\n\n![](./media/image3.png){width=\"6.141482939632546in\"\nheight=\"3.4152154418197727in\"}\n\n*Child Population exposure with \\>5 hazard count threshold*\n\n**Child-Focused Use Case**\n\nBy filtering the hazard count by child population, the indicator serves\nas a tool to identify areas where children face compounded climate\nrisks. It enables targeted planning for health, education, and\nprotection interventions, and supports more equitable resource\nallocation.\n\n**Aggregation and Applications**\n\nThe pixel-level results can be aggregated to administrative units (e.g.,\ndistrict, province) to calculate:\n\n- Total number of children exposed to one or more hazards\n\n- Number of children exposed to 1, 2, 3, 4 or more concurrent hazards\n\n- Distribution of hazard count among children within a region\n\nThis indicator supports decision-making in disaster risk reduction,\nclimate adaptation, and child-focused program design.\n\n**Multi-hazard intensity**\n\n**Definition and Purpose**\n\nThe Multi-Hazard Intensity indicator evaluates not only whether a\nlocation is exposed to hazards, but how severe or extreme those hazards\nare. This high-resolution metric---computed at approximately 10 km\nspatial resolution---integrates the magnitudes of various climate and\nclimate-sensitive hazards into a composite risk score for each location.\nUnlike a simple count of hazard types, this indicator distinguishes\nbetween areas experiencing frequent but moderate events and those\nexposed to less frequent but highly destructive climate extremes.\n\nBy capturing intensity, this metric offers a more nuanced understanding\nof risk, enabling local governments, humanitarian actors, and climate\nresilience planners to better prioritize areas that face more severe\nthreats---even if only from one or two dominant hazards.\n\n**Data Processing:**\n\nEach hazard layer---such as heatwave frequency, drought severity, or\nflood intensity---is first cleaned and normalized to ensure\ncomparability across different hazard types.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 54929, "end_char_idx": 59800, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a62f4d2e-2fa2-4e65-b869-420171b0c450": {"__data__": {"id_": "a62f4d2e-2fa2-4e65-b869-420171b0c450", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0b3bebde-8255-49be-aac5-fa4e1c0e0b56", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1675555f8b0f13d8b45311768ab3d09742ae1b2e78853460e14d2a14640987d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "38f7f4cf-b145-4f66-b782-7dfa4d7011ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1bc5fb937af7ec086d49abf93c07aab6e7b5f9ab4d81a6b590a6e652526e8218", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This high-resolution metric---computed at approximately 10 km\nspatial resolution---integrates the magnitudes of various climate and\nclimate-sensitive hazards into a composite risk score for each location.\nUnlike a simple count of hazard types, this indicator distinguishes\nbetween areas experiencing frequent but moderate events and those\nexposed to less frequent but highly destructive climate extremes.\n\nBy capturing intensity, this metric offers a more nuanced understanding\nof risk, enabling local governments, humanitarian actors, and climate\nresilience planners to better prioritize areas that face more severe\nthreats---even if only from one or two dominant hazards.\n\n**Data Processing:**\n\nEach hazard layer---such as heatwave frequency, drought severity, or\nflood intensity---is first cleaned and normalized to ensure\ncomparability across different hazard types. This process involves\nremoving non-informative values (e.g., zeros, NaNs), resampling to a\nconsistent 10 km grid using a maximum-value method (to preserve peaks),\nand applying log transformations followed by z-score scaling to\nstandardize the distributions. Pre-scaled datasets like SPI or soil\nmoisture anomaly are directly included after trimming outliers to\nimprove distribution symmetry.\n\nOnce the data layers are harmonized, they are stacked into a\nmulti-dimensional array, where each pixel holds values representing the\nmagnitude of different hazards. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is\nthen used to reduce this complex dataset to its most informative\ncomponents---capturing over 90% of total variance with just 11 principal\ncomponents. These components provide a way to synthesize multiple hazard\nsignals while preserving key differences between regions.\n\nFrom the PCA results, a weighted combination of principal component\nloadings---informed by each component\\'s explained variance---is used to\nderive a final composite hazard intensity score for each land pixel.\nThis produces a raw indicator of multi-hazard intensity, which is then\nnormalized to a 0--10 scale using min-max scaling. The final result is a\nsingle raster layer where each valid land pixel carries a score\nrepresenting the cumulative severity of climate risks in that location.\n\n> ![A close up of a number AI-generated content may be\n> incorrect.](./media/image4.png){width=\"0.5307075678040245in\"\n> height=\"0.6979166666666666in\"}![A map of the world AI-generated\n> content may be\n> incorrect.](./media/image5.png){width=\"5.346154855643045in\"\n> height=\"2.261801181102362in\"}\n>\n> *Averaged Pillar1 indicators at pixel level*\n\n**Child Population Exposure Estimate**\n\nThe thresholds are applied to categorize child populations based on\ndifferent levels of climate risk exposure.

This overlay allows\nfor the estimation of the number of children exposed to varying levels\nof climate hazard severity---from average exposure to the top 1% of most\nat-risk zones. For example, over 1.7 billion children globally are\nexposed to areas exceeding the mean hazard intensity value, while nearly\n19 million are in areas above the 99th percentile of severity.\n\nThis approach highlights not only where the most intense risks occur but\nalso who is affected---making it a powerful tool for guiding investments\nin child protection, school infrastructure resilience, and health\nservices. It also allows for threshold-based analysis, helping\ngovernments and agencies understand the scale of exposure at critical\nrisk levels (e.g., above the 90th percentile).\n\n**Sensitivity and Limitations**\n\nThe method allows for robust sensitivity testing, including the effect\nof resampling strategies, the number of PCA components used, and\nalternative normalization approaches. However, it also carries\nassumptions---such as the linearity of PCA and the weighting of\ncomponents---which must be carefully validated in different contexts.\n\nDespite these limitations, the Multi-Hazard Intensity metric offers a\nscalable, data-driven approach to understanding where high-severity\nclimate risks intersect with vulnerable populations---a critical step\ntoward effective and equitable climate resilience planning.\n\n# Child Vulnerability\n\nChildren face unique vulnerabilities that make them particularly\nsusceptible to climate and climate-sensitive hazards.

The first dose of the\ndiphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP1) serves as a proxy\nfor access to immunization services, while coverage of the third dose\n(DTP3) is often used as an indicator of how effectively countries are\ndelivering routine immunization services to children (a good proxy for\nchild health). Access to life-saving vaccines to combat diseases is not\nuniversal and varies across regions and countries\n([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/immunization/)).\n\nIndicators:\n\n- \u00a0Percentage of surviving infants\\* who received the first dose of\n  DTP-containing vaccine\n\n- \u00a0Percentage of surviving infants who received the third dose of\n  DTP-containing vaccine\n\n\\*Live-born infants who survive long enough to be eligible for\nvaccination [Survive and thrive: transforming care for every small and\nsick newborn](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241515887)\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 195 countries and territories.\n\nSource: WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC),\n2023 revision\n\nData Limitations: WUENIC is informed by reported administrative data and\nhousehold surveys, both of which can have limitations including\nincomplete reporting, misclassification or biases. When data gaps,\ninconsistencies without explanation or unreliable data exist, WUENIC\nuses various statistical methods such as interpolation or extrapolation,\nwhich may not accurately reflect the reality on the ground. The most\nrecent year estimates are informed by less data as surveys for the\nyoungest cohorts are not available.\n\n**Maternal health:**\n\nDespite recent progress, millions of births still occur without any\nassistance from a skilled attendant each year which is a good proxy for\nmaternal health in a country.\n\nIndicator: Percentage of deliveries attended by skilled health personnel\n\nCoverage: Data is available for [192]{.mark} countries and territories.\n\nSource: Joint UNICEF-WHO Database on Skilled Birth Attendance 2024.\n\nData Limitations: This indicator measures the extent to which the health\nsystem can support mothers during childbirth; however, it alone doesn't\nshow whether delivery care is actually available or accessible when\nneeded and the quality of delivery care being provided. Another\nlimitation is related to the standardization of the 'skilled' health\npersonnel across all countries and regions as different countries use\ndifferent job titles for healthcare workers.

Children suffering from stunting may never\nreach their full possible height nor their full cognitive potential.\nStunted children not only earn less as adults as a result of less\nschooling and learning difficulties when in school, but they are also\nmore likely to be at risk of overweight and obesity than children of\nnormal height\n([Source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/child-nutrition/)).\n\nIndicator: Prevalence of stunting (height for age \\<-2 standard\ndeviation from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child\nGrowth Standards) among children under 5 years of age\n\nCoverage: Data is available for [163]{.mark} countries and territories.\n\nSource: UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates\nExpanded Database: Stunting (Survey Estimates) 2023.\n\nData Limitations: Survey estimates have uncertainty due to both sampling\nerror and non-sampling error (e.g., measurement technical error,\nrecording error, etc.). The JME modelled estimates for stunting take\ninto account estimates of sampling error around survey estimates. While\nnon-sampling error cannot be accounted for or reviewed in full, when\navailable, a data quality review of weight, height and age data from\nhousehold surveys supports compilation of a time series that is\ncomparable across countries over time.\n\n**Child food poverty** is a distinct metric that refers to a child's\ninability to access and consume a nutritious and diverse diet in early\nchildhood. It is measured using UNICEF and WHO dietary diversity scores.\nChildren are defined as living in severe child food poverty if they\nconsume foods from two or fewer food groups out of eight food groups\n([Source](https://www.unicef.org/reports/child-food-poverty)).\n\nIndicator: Percentage of children 6--23 months of age consuming foods\nand beverages from zero, one or two out of eight defined food groups1\nduring the previous day (severe child food poverty)\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 108 countries and territories.\n\nSource: UNICEF Global Database on Infant and Young Child Feeding. Child\nfood poverty, December 2023.\n\nData Limitations: As household surveys are the primary source of data on\nchild food poverty, the estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to\nboth sampling and non-sampling error (e.g. misclassification of food\nitems in food groups, recording error etc.).\n\n## WASH\n\nSecuring access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene reduces\nillness and death, especially among children and it is critical for\ntheir survival and growth. Three indicators are considered under WASH.\n\n**Water**\n\nAt least basic drinking water refers to water from an improved source,\nprovided collection time is not more than 30 minutes for a round trip,\nincluding queuing\n([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/drinking-water/))\nwhere the improved sources must be accessible on premises, available\nwhen needed and free from contamination.\n\nIndicator: Proportion of population using improved drinking water\nsources no more than 30 mins roundtrip\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 207 countries and territories\n\nSource: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme -- WASH in households 2023\nupdate.\n\n**Sanitation**\n\nAt least basic sanitation refers to use of improved facilities that are\nnot shared with other households\n([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/sanitation/))\nand has a 'safely managed' service, excreta must either be safely\ndisposed of in situ or removed and treated offsite.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 66908, "end_char_idx": 71680, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09dff3f5-b27a-4339-b563-0b95594df512": {"__data__": {"id_": "09dff3f5-b27a-4339-b563-0b95594df512", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3224608d-de72-4636-8ee4-87a33ce5a45f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f476483eaa44e2503daf66f36fc495844533a3610ba7bbd453496718e4b3a08d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d6d7d2c-ee9a-4e45-baf6-d30a55a5a31e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d61f0f943fea5464f1f5a741f52325c5e700fde83c787dc499757f7050ea66d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Indicator: Proportion of population using improved drinking water\nsources no more than 30 mins roundtrip\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 207 countries and territories\n\nSource: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme -- WASH in households 2023\nupdate.\n\n**Sanitation**\n\nAt least basic sanitation refers to use of improved facilities that are\nnot shared with other households\n([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/sanitation/))\nand has a 'safely managed' service, excreta must either be safely\ndisposed of in situ or removed and treated offsite.\n\nIndicator: Proportion of population using improved sanitation facilities\nnot shared with other households\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 206 countries and territories.\n\nSource: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme -- WASH in households 2023\nupdate.\n\n**Hygiene**\n\nBasic hygiene refers to availability of a handwashing facility with soap\nand water at home\n([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/hygiene/)).\n\nIndicator: Proportion of population with a handwashing facility with\nsoap and water available at home\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 84 countries and territories.\n\nSource: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme -- WASH in households 2023\nupdate.\n\nData Limitations for WASH: JMP produces internationally comparable\nestimates based on national data sources.

Though the duration in each country varies, secondary education\ntypically covers ages 12 to 17 and is divided into two levels: lower\nsecondary education (spanning 3 to 4 years) and upper secondary\neducation (spanning 2 to 3 years). Although notable progress has been\nmade in the past few decades, challenges remain in reducing regional\ndisparities and inequalities among secondary school-age students from\ndifferent socioeconomic backgrounds.\n([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/education/secondary-education/)).\n\nThree indicators are considered under education: Lower secondary out of\nschool rate, lower secondary completion rate and learning poverty.\n\n**Lower secondary out of school**\n\nIndicator: Percentage of children out of school in lower secondary\neducation\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 115 countries and territories.\n\nSource: UNICEF global databases, 2024, based on DHS, MICS and other\nnational surveys.\n\nData Limitations: The main limitation lies in the data sources.\nAdministrative records are not well-suited to capture out-of-school\npopulations, as they only include children who are registered within the\neducation system. The recommended approach is to estimate out-of-school\nrates using household survey data. However, such surveys are not always\nconducted regularly or widely---particularly in countries or regions\nwith high rates of children not attending school.\n\n**Lower secondary completion rate**\n\nPercentage of cohort of children or young people three to five years\nolder than the intended age for the last grade of lower secondary\neducation who have completed that level of education.\n\nIndicator: Completion rate of children in lower secondary education\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 112 countries and territories.\n\nSource: UNICEF global databases, 2024, based on DHS, MICS and other\nnational surveys.\n\nData Limitations: A key limitation of this indicator is that it measures\nschool completion 3--5 years after the expected age of graduation. As a\nresult, it can only be calculated when at least three years have passed\nsince a child was expected to complete a given level of education.\n\n**Learning poverty**\n\nThe learning poverty indicator was launched by the World Bank and the\nUNESCO Institute for Statistics in 2019 helps to better understand the\nglobal learning crisis. High rates of learning poverty are an early\nsignal that education systems are failing to ensure that children\ndevelop critical foundational skills\n([source](https://www.unicef.org/media/122921/file/StateofLearningPoverty2022.pdf)).\n\nIndicator: Rate of learning poverty\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 122 countries and territories.\n\nSource: UNICEF global databases, 2024, based on DHS, MICS and other\nnational surveys.\n\nData Limitations: While this indicator effectively combines two critical\naspects of education---school access and learning outcomes---it is\nsignificantly limited by the availability and coverage of data on\nlearning outcomes. In many cases, these data are either outdated,\ninfrequent, or not representative, which restricts the robustness of the\nmeasure.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 71116, "end_char_idx": 75863, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d6d7d2c-ee9a-4e45-baf6-d30a55a5a31e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d6d7d2c-ee9a-4e45-baf6-d30a55a5a31e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "09dff3f5-b27a-4339-b563-0b95594df512", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a11f0429609ce08a734eb24e41a1e8076f8c4cbe62336b63e372123089dbe3e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "741c96d8-ae89-4cef-9c96-cf9eab2a603c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a658e0db8f2bebe20f9692666faf6d3f9cd28ff81a2ac6754f46944170af203a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "High rates of learning poverty are an early\nsignal that education systems are failing to ensure that children\ndevelop critical foundational skills\n([source](https://www.unicef.org/media/122921/file/StateofLearningPoverty2022.pdf)).\n\nIndicator: Rate of learning poverty\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 122 countries and territories.\n\nSource: UNICEF global databases, 2024, based on DHS, MICS and other\nnational surveys.\n\nData Limitations: While this indicator effectively combines two critical\naspects of education---school access and learning outcomes---it is\nsignificantly limited by the availability and coverage of data on\nlearning outcomes. In many cases, these data are either outdated,\ninfrequent, or not representative, which restricts the robustness of the\nmeasure.\n\n## Protection\n\nTwo indicators are considered under Child Protection: Child labor and\nChild marriage\n\n**Child labor**\n\nChildren around the world are routinely engaged in paid and unpaid forms\nof work that are not harmful to them. However, they are classified as\nchild labourers when they are either too young to work or are involved\nin hazardous activities that may compromise their physical, mental,\nsocial or educational development. A child is considered to be involved\nin child labour under the following conditions: (a) children 5--11 years\nold who, during the reference week, did at least one hour of economic\nactivity and/or more than 21 hours of unpaid household services, (b)\nchildren 12--14 years old who, during the reference week, did at least\n14 hours of economic activity and/or more than 21 hours of unpaid\nhousehold services, (c) children 15--17 years old who, during the\nreference week, did at least 43 hours of economic activity.\n\nIndicator: Percentage of children 5--17 years old involved in child\nlabour\n\nCoverage: Data is available for [85]{.mark} countries and territories.\n\nSource: UNICEF global databases, 2024, based on DHS, MICS and other\nnational surveys.\n\nData Limitations: While the concept of child labour includes working in\nactivities that are hazardous in nature, to ensure comparability of\nestimates over time and to minimize data quality issues, work beyond\nage-specific hourly thresholds is used as a proxy for hazardous work.\nFurther methodological work is needed to validate questions specifically\naimed at identifying children in hazardous working conditions.\nSimilarly, the worst forms of child labour are not currently captured in\nregular household surveys given difficulties in accurately and reliably\nmeasuring them. In addition, 'own use production of goods', including\nactivities such as fetching water and collecting firewood, have been\nclassified as unpaid household services (i.e., household chores).\n(UNICEF, 2020).\n\n**Child Marriage**\n\nMarriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation of human\nrights. Many factors interact to placing a child at risk of marriage,\nincluding poverty, the perception that marriage will provide\n'protection', family honor, social norms, customary or religious laws\nthat condone the practice, an inadequate legislative framework and the\nstate of a country's civil registration system. While the practice is\nmore common among girls than boys, it is a violation of rights\nregardless of sex\n([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/child-marriage/)).\n\nIndicator: Total number of girls and women of all ages who were first\nmarried or in union before age 18\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 140 countries and territories.\n\nSource: UNICEF global databases, 2024, based on DHS, MICS and other\nnational surveys.\n\nData Limitations: The measure of child marriage is retrospective in\nnature by design, capturing age at first marriage among a population\nthat has completed the risk period (i.e., adult women). Thus, there is\nan inherent time lag between the moment at which child marriages occur\nand when they show up in the data: Prevalence estimates reflect child\nmarriages that occurred at least two years and as many as six or more\nyears prior to the reported year. While it is also possible to measure\nthe current marital status of girls under age 18, such measures would\nprovide an underestimation of the level of child marriage, as girls who\nare not currently married may still do so before they turn 18 (UNICEF,\n2020).\n\n## Poverty\n\n**Multi-dimensional poverty**\n\nChild poverty measures the means (or the lack thereof) to realize child\nrights that crucially and directly rely on continuously/periodically\nusing material elements such as goods and services. These rights include\nclothing, education, health, housing, information, nutrition, play,\nsanitation, and water. The lack of these basic needs often results in\ndeficits that cannot easily be overcome later in life.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 75089, "end_char_idx": 79832, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "741c96d8-ae89-4cef-9c96-cf9eab2a603c": {"__data__": {"id_": "741c96d8-ae89-4cef-9c96-cf9eab2a603c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d6d7d2c-ee9a-4e45-baf6-d30a55a5a31e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d61f0f943fea5464f1f5a741f52325c5e700fde83c787dc499757f7050ea66d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4d86fc0c-c67e-4556-855a-cf97e00a75fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "180dc24a90ba279379bf48aa2f6ab37d6fcdc0fedf4118465a73c4a1b63c89d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "While it is also possible to measure\nthe current marital status of girls under age 18, such measures would\nprovide an underestimation of the level of child marriage, as girls who\nare not currently married may still do so before they turn 18 (UNICEF,\n2020).\n\n## Poverty\n\n**Multi-dimensional poverty**\n\nChild poverty measures the means (or the lack thereof) to realize child\nrights that crucially and directly rely on continuously/periodically\nusing material elements such as goods and services.

Child-sensitive social protection systems -- programs such as\ncash transfers, health insurance and education subsidies -- can help\nmake sure that no child is left behind because of poverty. But globally,\nfew children benefit. For almost three out of every four children,\nsocial protection programs remain out of reach\n([source](http://unicef.org/innocenti/areas-of-work/child-poverty-and-social-protection)).\n\nIndicator: Percentage of children under 5 covered by social protection\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 182 countries and territories.\n\nSource: UNSD SDG Database\n\nData Limitations: This indicator only includes cash transfers, and not\nall elements of social protection.\n\n## Child Survival\n\n**Under five mortality**\n\nThe under-five mortality rate refers to the probability a newborn would\ndie before reaching exactly 5 years of age, expressed per 1,000 live\nbirths\n([source](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality/)).\n\nIndicator: Mortality rate under five per 1000 live births\n\nCoverage: Data is available for 199 countries and territories.\n\nSource: UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation\n\nData Limitations: Under-5 mortality data, while crucial, often faces\nlimitations such as varying reporting standards and data collection\nmethodologies across different countries. Additionally, the data may not\nalways capture the specific causes of death at a granular level or\nadequately reflect localized disparities within countries.\n\n# Children Climate Risk Index (CCRI)\n\n## Background\n\nIn 2021, UNICEF released the first global Children Climate Risk Index\n(CCRI) that identified the countries that are most-at risk for both\nclimate and environmental hazards -- estimating that one billion\nchildren live in countries facing extreme risks to their ability to\nsurvive, grow and thrive. In 2023, UNICEF released the Sustainability\nand Climate Change Action Plan (SCAP) galvanizing a global commitment to\nensure a sustainable world and protect the most vulnerable children and\nin 2024 a new Climate and Environment data unit was established to\nenable easy access to data, analysis for global, regional and\ncountry-level applications by developing a global child hazard database\nand updating the CCRI. Following extensive internal and external\nconsultations, CCRI was revised and updated using the best available\nglobal hazard and vulnerability data to better understand the extent of\nvulnerable children's exposure to climate and climate-sensitive hazards.\n\nCCRI is a composite index that aims to rank countries where vulnerable\nchildren are also exposed to a wide range of climate and environmental\nhazards. Recognizing that children are disproportionately affected by\nthese hazards, CCRI provides a comprehensive assessment of how climate\nand environmental hazards intersect with children's existing\nvulnerabilities.\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\nCCRI 2025 adopted the hazard x exposure x vulnerability as the\nfoundational risk framework (IPCC, 2020).\n\n- **Risk** refers to the potential of adverse consequences, resulting\n  from dynamic interactions between climate-related hazards with the\n  exposure and vulnerability of children or associated assets and\n  systems to the hazards.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 79125, "end_char_idx": 83868, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d86fc0c-c67e-4556-855a-cf97e00a75fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d86fc0c-c67e-4556-855a-cf97e00a75fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "741c96d8-ae89-4cef-9c96-cf9eab2a603c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a658e0db8f2bebe20f9692666faf6d3f9cd28ff81a2ac6754f46944170af203a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "38cab119-089c-47c0-9c0e-2d35048075ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0af515eb37e86e25d52db2f3d45ed1835fdedd63733ebc3aa1d4939535e2e8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Following extensive internal and external\nconsultations, CCRI was revised and updated using the best available\nglobal hazard and vulnerability data to better understand the extent of\nvulnerable children's exposure to climate and climate-sensitive hazards.\n\nCCRI is a composite index that aims to rank countries where vulnerable\nchildren are also exposed to a wide range of climate and environmental\nhazards.

CCRI 2025, similar to the earlier version, summarizes\nrisk analysis into two critical pillars with components, sub-components\nand indicators:\n\n- **Pillar 1** looks at **children's exposure to climate hazards** such\n  as riverine and coastal floods, tropical storms, droughts, heatwaves,\n  sand & dust storms, fires and climate-sensitive hazards such as air\n  pollution and vector borne diseases.\n\n- **Pillar 2** considers the inherent **vulnerabilities of children** in\n  WASH, nutrition, protection, health, education, poverty and child\n  survival.\n\nBy integrating the two pillars, CCRI provides a powerful framework to\nunderstand the specific risks that children face. Understanding these\ncomplex interactions is crucial to better prepare, mitigate and adapt to\nthe rapidly evolving climate crisis. This data-driven tool is aimed to\nallow UNICEF country offices, policy makers, humanitarian organizations,\nand other relevant stakeholders to advocate, prioritize action and\nallocate resources effectively to protect the most vulnerable children,\nbuilding a climate resilient future for all. Work is underway to develop\nglobal indicators for monitoring adaptation to climate change[^1] and\nthese could potentially be included as a third pillar in future\niterations of CCRI.\n\nEach pillar in CCRI 2025 consists of components, sub-components (where\nneeded) and indicators.\n\nIn CCRI 2025, climate and climate-sensitive hazards refer to those\nhazards that are directly or indirectly influenced by Earth's climate\nsystem. There is no universal classification available, and the\nfollowing definitions are adopted for the purpose of CCRI 2025.\n\n**Climate hazard** refers to natural events that are pre-dominantly\nhydro-meteorological in nature such as floods, tropical storms,\nheatwaves, wildfires and droughts. These hazards can be exacerbated by\nclimate change, leading to increased frequency, intensity, and\nunpredictability (IPCC, 2022).\n\n**Climate sensitive hazard** refers to hazards such as air pollution and\nvector borne diseases that are sensitive to changes in climate patterns,\nsuch as temperature and precipitation, which can affect the distribution\nand intensity of these risks (IPCC, 2022).\n\nUnderstanding climate hazards is core to risk analysis, emergency\npreparedness and planning for effective mitigation and adaptation.\nPillar 1 combines children's exposure to multiple hazards where open,\nglobal data was available. *Please note that the list of climate and\nclimate-sensitive hazards is not comprehensive, and other relevant\nhazards might not have been included due to lack of global data\navailability.*\n\n![A screenshot of a computer screen AI-generated content may be\nincorrect.](./media/image7.png){width=\"4.618055555555555in\"\nheight=\"3.520262467191601in\"}\n\n*Fig 1: CCRI 2025 Theoretical Framework*\n\n**What is new in CCRI 2025?**\n\n- CCRI 2025 focuses more on climate and climate-sensitive hazards\n  whereas CCRI 2021 included a mix of climate and environmental hazards.\n  Since the list of hazards and the underlying datasets are different,\n  the two indices are not comparable.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 82887, "end_char_idx": 87495, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38cab119-089c-47c0-9c0e-2d35048075ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "38cab119-089c-47c0-9c0e-2d35048075ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d86fc0c-c67e-4556-855a-cf97e00a75fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "180dc24a90ba279379bf48aa2f6ab37d6fcdc0fedf4118465a73c4a1b63c89d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "381289ba-2ce9-43e2-86e4-11a0421b090a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df82573ae6f62ddbd72d945225ea44affd4cde1dc4dead2e2cb6e580425974bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Pillar 1 combines children's exposure to multiple hazards where open,\nglobal data was available. *Please note that the list of climate and\nclimate-sensitive hazards is not comprehensive, and other relevant\nhazards might not have been included due to lack of global data\navailability.*\n\n![A screenshot of a computer screen AI-generated content may be\nincorrect.](./media/image7.png){width=\"4.618055555555555in\"\nheight=\"3.520262467191601in\"}\n\n*Fig 1: CCRI 2025 Theoretical Framework*\n\n**What is new in CCRI 2025?**\n\n- CCRI 2025 focuses more on climate and climate-sensitive hazards\n  whereas CCRI 2021 included a mix of climate and environmental hazards.\n  Since the list of hazards and the underlying datasets are different,\n  the two indices are not comparable.\n\n- CCRI 2025 also estimates the index by country as well as gridded\n  analysis, pinpointing the hotspot areas where vulnerable children are\n  exposed to multiple extreme hazard events in all countries\n\n- CCRI 2025 includes the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) which\n  were omitted from CCRI 2021 due to lack of data availability at that\n  time.\n\n- CCRI 2025 also regroups sub-components of the child vulnerability\n  pillar to align with UNICEF programmes, making poverty and child\n  survival as separate components, as well as splitting health and\n  nutrition into separate components.\n\n**What is not included in CCRI 2025?**\n\n- CCRI 2025 does not include attribution (linking directly to\n  anthropogenic climate hazards) but identifies children's exposure to\n  all hazards. In other words, it is not quantifying the impact of\n  human-induced climate change on children separately from naturally\n  occurring extreme weather events.\n\n- CCRI 2025 does not look at how climate and climate-sensitive hazards\n  increases vulnerability but at where vulnerable children are exposed\n  to these hazards.\n\n- CCRI 2025 does not include analysis on future projections of climate\n  risks on children, given the uncertainty in available projections and\n  child population. There are no reliable, modelled estimates available\n  for future child vulnerability.\n\n- CCRI 2025 does not include all the possible relevant indicators on\n  climate and climate-sensitive hazards, only those for which open,\n  quantifiable, spatially distributed global data are available.\n\n- CCRI 2025 does not include any predictions.\n\n**How to interpret CCRI 2025?**\n\nInterpreting the CCRI requires understanding its multifaceted nature as\na composite index. It should be interpreted not merely as a measure of\nhow many hazards children are exposed to, but as a comprehensive\nindicator of the overall risks they face. A higher CCRI score signifies\nnot just higher exposure, but also a diminished capacity to cope with\nand recover from these shocks due to underlying deprivations. This\nholistic perspective highlights regions and populations where both\nproactive climate action and urgent investments in strengthening\nchild-centered services are most critically needed to build resilience\nand safeguard children\\'s futures.\n\n**Pillar 1: Children Exposure to Hazards**\n\nWith 10 components and 30 indicators, Pillar 1 aggregates absolute and\nrelative exposure to individual hazard at a country level. The 10\nhazards include:\n\n1.  Flood -- Riverine\n\n2.  Flood -- Coastal\n\n3.  Drought -- Agricultural, Meteorological\n\n4.  Tropical Storm\n\n5.  Heatwaves (frequency, intensity, duration)\n\n6.

Health\n\n2.  Nutrition\n\n3.  WASH\n\n4.  Education\n\n5.  Protection\n\n6.  Poverty\n\n7.  Child Survival\n\n![](./media/image9.png){width=\"5.715277777777778in\"\nheight=\"3.5889523184601924in\"}\n\n**Considerations for vulnerability indicators:**\n\n- Child vulnerability indicators were chosen after extensive internal\n  consultations with sector-specific and data experts. While there are\n  over 50 child vulnerability indicators, for the purpose of CCRI 2025,\n  17 are considered across seven components.\n\n- All vulnerability indicators are considered at country level and the\n  last available data has been assumed to be current.\n\n- All definitions and data on child vulnerability are obtained from\n  data.unicef.org.\n\n- Each indicator that is added increases complexity and reduces\n  coverage. Efforts have been made to conduct extensive sensitivity\n  analysis to best combine individual indicators and components.\n\n- When a particular indicator is not available for a country, it is not\n  considered in the average where the weights of individual indicators\n  are not evenly applied. Since the indicators are highly correlated,\n  our sensitivity analysis have limited to no impact on the final score.\n\n- A combination of indicators showing vulnerability and where data\n  unavailable, proxies using lack of coping capacity is used\n\n## Methodology\n\nCCRI composite index is designed to encompass a comprehensive list of\nchildren's exposure to various hazards and vulnerabilities. Each pillar\nis processed separately with an internally established semi-automated\ndata pipeline and follows multiple steps.\n\n**Data Preparation**\n\nFor pillar 1 hazard data, raw raster data collected from various\nestablished data sources is processed using Google Earth Engine. Raster\ndata is first uploaded as an Image Collection asset representing each\nhazard. Image Collections are processed into a single layer by spatially\nassembling into a continuous image using mosaicking. All raster tiles\nare merged and clipped to represent global land boundaries using\ncoastline layer and as discussed earlier 100-year return period is used\nfor probabilistic models and the most recent ten- year average of\nlong-term observations.\n\nFor pillar 2, all indicators are downloaded using UNICEF's Data\nWarehouse -- [SDMX](https://sdmx.data.unicef.org/overview.html) API.\n\n**Thresholding**\n\nFor pillar 1 hazard data, thresholds are chosen based on existing\nliterature and expert feedback. Meticulous steps were taken to widely\nconsult with the external experts and review the most recent\nstate-of-the-art research available.

Zonal statistics is used to\nsummarize the total and percentage of children exposed by countries and\nterritories.\n\n**Imputation of Missing Values**\n\nImputation is a statistical technique used to estimate and fill in\nmissing values within a dataset.\n\nAll indicators used in CCRI are chosen on the basis of the six\nestablished criteria, but most indicators still lack global coverage and\nare not regularly updated every year. This results in a significant\nnumber of missing values. As well known in literature, composite\nindicators do not necessarily require imputation of missing values\nwithin a component score if the indicators have high correlation\n([source](https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/inform-index/Portals/0/InfoRM/Publications/EUR%2030037%20-%20Imputation%20of%20missing%20values%20in%20the%20INFORM%20Global%20Risk%20Index%20-%20print.pdf)).\n\nFor CCRI 2025, our primary approach is a pre-imputation process where if\ndata for most recent year was not available, the most recent data from\nthe past ten years were considered. The next approach is a complete case\nanalysis, or case deletion. This means that if a particular record\n(e.g., for a specific country or sub-national unit) has at least 75% of\nits data points missing for the vulnerability variables being analyzed,\nthat entire record is excluded from the analysis. This approach is\naligned with international best practices and guidance from both the\nOECD Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators (OECD, 2008) and the\nINFORM Risk Index Methodology (European Commission, 2023).\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge the inherent limitation of this method:\nthis approach risks ignoring potential systematic differences between\nthe complete and incomplete samples and we recognize that this could\nlead to results that do not fully represent the entire population or all\ngeographic areas. Sensitivity analysis is given below and as shown with\nhigh correlation there is relatively less to no impact of missing data\non final index scores.\n\n**Thresholds for missing vulnerability indicators/sensitivity\nanalysis**\u00a0\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to evaluate how the\ncombined Pillar 1 (exposure) and Pillar 2 (development indicators)\nrankings of countries respond to varying levels of missing data. By\niteratively applying thresholds from 0.1 to 0.9 for the minimum\nproportion of available Pillar 2 indicators, we computed geometric and\narithmetic averages, merged them with Pillar 1 scores, and ranked\ncountries at each threshold.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 93467, "end_char_idx": 98430, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2a74004-a549-4c36-933c-a4f801148637": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2a74004-a549-4c36-933c-a4f801148637", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b5f2eaa-108d-43c2-a147-8a693893ae98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "86a58f6c9e6fdba051e9f2e9d86dbe12be5eda0d2a0243000041474ed02d8cc8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d63ec46-ec7c-4f09-b94e-d99bdda05658", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b07fc84d5a8bb068d97eb9aa6ceb3ec37546be1775137e4ef3b04de092a989e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "It is crucial to acknowledge the inherent limitation of this method:\nthis approach risks ignoring potential systematic differences between\nthe complete and incomplete samples and we recognize that this could\nlead to results that do not fully represent the entire population or all\ngeographic areas.

This ensures that all variables contribute equally to the\nfinal index. Common methods include min-max normalization, where data is\nscaled to a range of 0 to 1, and z-score normalization, which adjusts\ndata based on the mean and standard deviation.\n\nIn CCRI 2025, the values are normalized using the min-max technique to a\n0-10 scale for all indicators, components and pillars. Min-Max\nnormalizes indicators to an identical range by subtracting the minimum\nvalue and dividing by the range of the indicator values, noting that\nextreme values/or outliers could distort the transformed indicator. But\none notable advantage is that it could widen the range of indicators\nlying within a small interval, increasing the effect on the composite\nindicator.\n\nThe min and max values are considered where skewness is lower than 2 AND\nkurtosis is lower than 3.5. Skewness and kurtosis are calculated\niteratively for the whole dataset without the obvious outliers, until\npre-set conditions are met. The minimum and maximum data point of the\nremaining dataset are taken as min and max.\n\nNormalized indicator score (0-10): 10 - (baseline maximum -- raw data\nvalue) / (baseline maximum -- baseline minimum) x 10\n\n+-----------------------------------+-------+------+------------------+\n| **Indicator**                     | **    | **M  | **Notes**        |\n|                                   |

This step typically uses weighted averages or\nother statistical methods to summarize the data.\u00a0Aggregation helps in\nsimplifying complex data sets into a more understandable and actionable\nformat\n\nCCRI 2025 uses a blended aggregation method using both geometric and\narithmetic average.\n\nThe\u00a0**arithmetic mean**\u00a0is the sum of a set of values divided by the\nnumber of values. It is the most common measure of central tendency and\nis easy to calculate and understand. However, it can be heavily\ninfluenced by outliers, which can skew the mean and give a misleading\nrepresentation of the data set. It is best used when the data is\nsymmetrically distributed without extreme values and where there is\ncompensability between the indicators.\n\nThe\u00a0**geometric mean**\u00a0is the nth root of the product of n values. It is\nparticularly useful for data sets with values that are multiplicative or\nvary exponentially, such as growth rates. The geometric mean is less\naffected by extreme values compared to the arithmetic mean, providing a\nmore accurate measure for skewed distributions. However, it is more\ncomplex to calculate and interpret, and it cannot be used with data sets\ncontaining zero or negative values.\n\n**Log transformation**\u00a0is a mathematical technique used to convert data\nto a logarithmic scale. This transformation helps in stabilizing\nvariance, making the data more normally distributed, and reducing the\nimpact of outliers. It is particularly useful for data sets with a wide\nrange of values or exponential growth patterns.\n\nGeometric mean is used to aggregate at pillar level, as well as to\naggregate relative and absolute exposure to individual hazard components\nin Pillar 1. Arithmetic mean is used where we have two indicators that\nshow compensability and used to aggregate the indicators and components\nin Pillar 2. By adopting a blended method, CCRI can capture both the\ncompounding effects of hazards as well as the independent effects of\neach vulnerability indicator.\n\nAny future improvements in any of the indicators will directly influence\nthe index.\n\nIf there are no values for a specific indicator, it is not counted\ntowards the aggregation. For pillar 1 hazard layers, all pixels with no\nvalues are assumed to be no hazard.\n\n**Correlation and sensitivity analysis**\n\n**Assessing Alignment Between CCRI P1 and Spatial Multi-Hazard Risk**\n\nThis analysis explores whether countries with high scores on UNICEF's\nCCRI P1 component---which reflects child exposure to multiple climate\nhazards---also rank highly when using gridded data on hazard intensity\nand the number of overlapping hazards. Using high-resolution population\nand hazard data, we calculated the number of children exposed by country\nand compared the results with CCRI P1 rankings. The comparison showed a\nstrong correlation: for example, the Spearman correlation between CCRI\nP1 and multi-hazard intensity exposure was \u03c1 = 0.817 (p \\< 0.001), and\nthe Kendall rank correlation was \u03c4 = 0.664 (p \\< 0.001). These results\nconfirm that CCRI P1 aligns well with independent, spatially detailed\nmeasures of climate risk, while also showing the added value of\nhigh-resolution analysis.\n\n![](./media/image16.png){width=\"5.087110673665792in\"\nheight=\"3.8003291776027996in\"}\n\n**Comparison of CCRI P2 with Global Development and Risk Indices**\n\nIn the first part of the analysis, we compared CCRI P2 values---which\nreflect a country's adaptive capacity, vulnerability, and access to\nservices relevant to children---with two well-known global indices: the\nND-GAIN Country Index and the Human Development Index (HDI).

The\nprocess includes validating the index through statistical analysis and\nexpert review to ensure its accuracy and reliability.\n\nCCRI composite index also uses a 0-10 scale, where 10 represents the\nhighest multi-hazard risk.\n\n![A diagram of a diagram AI-generated content may be\nincorrect.](./media/image19.png){width=\"6.320138888888889in\"\nheight=\"2.8303510498687663in\"}\n\n*Pillar 1 Workflow*\n\n![A diagram of a diagram AI-generated content may be\nincorrect.](./media/image20.png){width=\"5.996847112860892in\"\nheight=\"2.263888888888889in\"}\n\n*Pillar 2 workflow*\n\n**Key Considerations and Limitations of the Database**\n\nIt\\'s important to understand the following considerations and\nlimitations when interpreting the data presented in this database:\n\n- **CCRI Scope:** The Children\\'s Climate Risk Index (CCRI) quantifies\n  the compounded risk children face by identifying those who are already\n  vulnerable (due to factors like poverty or lack of access to essential\n  services) and simultaneously exposed to climate-related hazards. It\n  does not, however, directly quantify the overall economic or social\n  impact of climate change.\n\n- **Population Data:** The population estimates, including all 2024\n  figures derived from WorldPop data, are subject to the inherent\n  limitations of that dataset. These limitations specifically apply to\n  population estimates and often do not account for dynamic population\n  movements, such as internal migration or displacement. It might also\n  not fully match with national estimates, especially if the census is\n  quite outdated.\n\n- **Hazard Data Characteristics:** It\\'s important to distinguish\n  between hazard data types: some hazards are represented by\n  probabilistic models (e.g., future flood likelihood), while others are\n  based on historical observations (e.g., past drought events). This\n  distinction influences their interpretation.\n\n- **Data Gaps in Hazard Coverage:** While striving for comprehensive\n  coverage, certain critical hazards, despite their relevance, currently\n  lack globally available, open-source data that meets the necessary\n  standards for inclusion in this database. These are noted where\n  applicable.\n\n- **Vulnerability Measurement Challenges:** While critical for a\n  holistic understanding of risk, some dimensions of vulnerability are\n  inherently difficult to measure consistently across diverse countries.\n  This presents a challenge for their inclusion in a standardized global\n  measure, leading to a focus on indicators with greater cross-country\n  comparability.\n\n- **Vulnerability Data Handling and Sub-national Limitations:**\n  Information on the number of countries with available survey data for\n  specific vulnerability dimensions, along with detailed explanations of\n  how missing data are managed (e.g., complete case analysis, where\n  records with at least 75% missing data are omitted, with\n  acknowledgement of potential biases), is provided in relevant\n  sections.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 121473, "end_char_idx": 126034, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3c53d6c-bbeb-4a2b-b276-e7b154f71419": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3c53d6c-bbeb-4a2b-b276-e7b154f71419", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13c2baac-33f0-48c0-b089-7248713973b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff60c061325e925bf1dfdc1932c4b8136795f6834931fef48bf53125ca2a5e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9529b468-c68c-4735-9468-0491adbabb37", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "33fad2d46d0c20529ee36e8de792cb3ae301533af9aadf559e1599d875f960ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "99157505-250c-4b1f-ad1a-1f5963ffdce5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "732c07fa5e88491d26ffc0a2987465d00198c15cdc9f97f02f720a2333bd9fb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "These are noted where\n  applicable.\n\n- **Vulnerability Measurement Challenges:** While critical for a\n  holistic understanding of risk, some dimensions of vulnerability are\n  inherently difficult to measure consistently across diverse countries.\n  This presents a challenge for their inclusion in a standardized global\n  measure, leading to a focus on indicators with greater cross-country\n  comparability.\n\n- **Vulnerability Data Handling and Sub-national Limitations:**\n  Information on the number of countries with available survey data for\n  specific vulnerability dimensions, along with detailed explanations of\n  how missing data are managed (e.g., complete case analysis, where\n  records with at least 75% missing data are omitted, with\n  acknowledgement of potential biases), is provided in relevant\n  sections. It is also important to note any specific limitations\n  regarding the availability or granularity of sub-national\n  vulnerability data.\n\n- **Nature of Estimates:** The hazard data presented comprises global\n  estimates derived from a range of publicly available datasets. These\n  estimates do not necessarily represent or align with official datasets\n  collected by national governments.\n\n- **Relative Index Comparison:** All indices within this database,\n  including the CCRI, are designed for relative comparison among the\n  countries included in the model. This means that a country\\'s\n  performance on any given index is assessed as comparatively better or\n  worse in relation to all other countries within the model, rather than\n  against an absolute benchmark.\n\n**Reproducibility Package**\n\nhttps://github.com/unicef/CCRI\n\n[Programming Environment]{.mark}\n\n[Include Data Map]{.mark}\n\n[Data Linkage table (could be the same as catalog)]{.mark}\n\n[Master Dataset]{.mark}\n\n[Data Flow chart]{.mark}\n\n**Data licensing and copyrights**\n\nAll data used in CCRI 2025 is open source.\n\n**Acknowledgement**\n\nVoluntary external groups have been established with experts from\nvarious fields, including climate science, data analysis, Earth\nobservation and geospatial technology.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  **Institution/Unit**               **Name**\n  ---------------------------------- ------------------------------------\n  Vrije Universiteit Brussel         Wim Thierry\n\n  ECMWF and Copernicus Climate       Delphine Deryng\n\n  Potsdam Institute for Climate      Levke Caesar\n  Impact Research                    \n\n  Data for Children Collaborative    Fraser Macdonald, Massimo Bollasina,\n                                     Gary Wamough\n\n  Columbia University                Andrew Kruczkiewicz\n\n  Beijing Institute of Technology    Chi Zhang\n\n  Tsinghua University                Wenjia Cai\n\n  World Bank                         Pierre Chrzanowski, Mattia Amadio\n\n  ESA                                Rochelle Schneider\n\n  Barcelona Supercomputing Center    Rachel Lowe\n\n  NASA                               Robert Emberson\n\n  IIASA                              Lisa Thalheimer\n\n  EU Joint Research Center           Karmen Poljansek, Sepher Marzi\n\n  Climate Central                    Kristina Dahl\n\n  MIT                                Arlene Fiore\n\n  LHSTM                              Chole Brimicombe\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpecial thanks to Rosa Pietroiusti from VUB for her contribution on\nattribution analysis\n\n# Appendix\n\n**Hazard Data catalog**\n\n![](./media/image21.png){width=\"7.2476115485564305in\"\nheight=\"2.7968350831146105in\"}\n\n**References**\n\n- Baugh, Calum; Colonese, Juan; D\\'Angelo, Claudia; Dottori, Francesco;\n  Neal, Jeffrey; Prudhomme, Christel; Salamon, Peter (2024): Global\n  River Flood Hazard Maps.
